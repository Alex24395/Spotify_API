Linkin Park,LOST IN THE ECHO,"Yeah!
Yo, you were that foundation
Never gonna be another one, no
I followed, so taken
So conditioned, I could never let go

Then sorrow, then sickness
Then the shock when you flip it on me
So hollow, so vicious
So afraid I couldn't let myself see

That I could never be held
Back or up no, I hold myself
Check the rep, yep, you know mine well
Forget the rest, let them know my hell

There and back, yet my soul ain't sell
Kept respect up, the best, they fell
Let the rest be the tale they tell
That I was there, sayin'

In these promises broken
Deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So one last lie
I can see through
This time I've finally let you 
Go, go, go

Test my will, test my heart
Let me tell you how the odds gonna stack up
Y'all go hard, I go smart
How's that working out for y'all in the back, huh?

I've seen that frustration
Been crossed and lost and told no
And I've come back unshaken
Let down and lived and let go

So you can let it be known
I don't hold back, I hold my own
I can't be mapped, I can't be cloned
I can't C-flat, it ain't my tone

I can't fall back, I came too far
Haul myself up and learn my scars
Let the bells ring wherever they are
'Cause I was there saying

In these promises broken
Deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So one last lie
I can see through
This time I've finally let you go

(Go)
(Go)
(Go)
(Go)
(Go)

No, you can tell 'em all now
I don't back up, I don't back down
I don't fold up and I don't bow
I don't roll over, don't know how

I don't care where the enemies are
Can't be stopped, all I know, go hard
Won't forget how I got this far
For every time saying

In these promises broken
Deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So one last lie
I can see through
This time I've finally let you

(Go)
Go
(Go)
Go
(Go)

Imagine Dragons,Thunder,"Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things and
Wanna leave my own life behind

Not a yes sir, not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder

Thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun-, thunder
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun-, thunder
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder

Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning and the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning and the thunder
Thunder, thunder
Thunder

Kids were laughing in my classes
While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star

You say you're basic, you say you're easy
You're always riding in the backseat
Now I'm smiling from the stage while
You were clapping in the nose bleeds

Thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun-, thunder
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun-, thunder
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder

Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning and the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning and the thunder

Gary Jules,Mad World (Feat. Michael Andrews),"All around me are familiar faces
Worn-out places, worn-out faces
Bright and early for their daily races
Going nowhere, going nowhere

Their tears are filling up their glasses
No expression, no expression
Hide my head, I want to drown my sorrow
No tomorrow, no tomorrow

And I find it kind of funny, I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you, I find it hard to take
When people run in circles it's a very, very

Mad world
Mad world

Children waiting for the day they feel good
Happy birthday, happy birthday
And I feel the way that every child should
Sit and listen, sit and listen

Went to school and I was very nervous
No one knew me, no one knew me
Hello, teacher, tell me, what's my lesson?
Look right through me, look right through me

And I find it kind of funny, I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you, I find it hard to take
When people run in circles it's a very, very

Mad world
Mad world
Enlarging your world
Mad world"

You're not allowed to touch, but you can stare

The Vamps,Middle Of The Night,"I keep coming back to that moment
Where it all fell apart
So I try and drink my emotions
Till I can't feel my heart

And I don't understand
How you slipped through my hands
And I'll do all I can
To get you out of my head

So when I call you in the middle of the night
And I'm choking on the words 'cause I miss you
Baby, don't tell me I'm out of time
I got so much of my loving to give you

In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
I need you
In the middle of the night

I've got no good explanation
For what I put you through
Managing my expectations
Is what I never do

Yeah and I don't understand
How you slipped through my hands
And I'm trying all I can
To forget you again

So when I call you in the middle of the night

Yeah, I would have a show like Oprah, I would be the host of
Everyday Christmas, give Travie a wish list

And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had shit

Give away a few Mercedes like, ""Here lady, have this""
And last, but not, least grant somebody their last wish
It's been a couple months that I've been single, so
You can call me Travie Claus, minus the ho ho

Toss a couple milli in the air just for the heck of it
But keep the fives, twentys, tens and Bens completely separate

And yeah, I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession, but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatever's left and just split it up
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks

And not a single tummy around me would know what hungry was
Eating good, sleeping soundly
I know we all have a similar dream
Go in your pocket pull out your wallet, put it in the air and sing

With the breeze and the birds
Tangled up in the tall grass
With my lips on hers
On the highway to heaven
Headed south of her smile
Get there when we get there
Every inch is a mile

But it was just a dream.

When you will have to rise
Above the best and prove yourself
Your spirit never dies.

Farewell, I've gone
To take my throne above
But don't weep for me
'Cause this will be the labour of my love

Linkin Park,What I've Done,"In this farewell, there's no blood, there's no alibi
'Cause I've drawn regret from the truth of a thousand lies
So let mercy come and wash away what I've done

I'll face myself to cross out what I've become
Erase myself and let go of what I've done

Put to rest what you thought of me
While I clean this slate with the hands of uncertainty
So let mercy come, and wash away what I've done

I'll face myself to cross out what I've become
Erase myself and let go of what I've done

For what I've done, I'll start again and whatever pain may come
Today this ends, I'm forgiving what I've done
I'll face myself to cross out what I've become
Erase myself and let go of what I've done

(Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na)
What I've done

Fall Out Boy,My Songs Know What You Did In The Dark (Light Em Up),"Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

B-B-Be careful making wishes in the a-dark, dark
Can't be sure when they've hit their mark, mark
And besides in the mean-meantime, I'm
Just dreaming of tearing you apart, ah

I'm in the de-details with the a-Devil
You know the world can never get me on my level
I just gotta get you out the cage
I'm a young lover's rage
Gonna need a spark to ignite

But my songs know what you did in the dark

So light 'em up, up, up

In the dark, dark
Oh, oh, oh
In the dark, dark

Well, the writers keep writing what they write
Somewhere another pretty vein just (Ah, ah) died
I got the scars from tomorrow and I wish you could see
That you’re the antidote to everything except for me (do we)

A constellation of tears on your lashes
Burn everything you love, then burn the ashes
In the end everything collides, my childhood 
Spat back out the monster that you see

My songs know what you did in the dark

So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire
So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up

Machine Gun Kelly,Alice In Wonderland,"I was raised on the separate side of the tracks in the land where the land where the wild things roam
...Grow... calling me girl, Alice in Wonderland... done of me... Stumbalin
Coming back to my senses from the sound of thunderin
Trees talking to me wonderin if I'll ever come again
Every single day until I'm sick in the sun again
Starin' at the ripples, skippin rocks in the pond again
Stimulatin every single sound when I'm ponderin
In the green ...like a summer ...

What shall I do, where do I go ... under the ...
... Put it to smoke ...I wonder if you got it to show
There are things talking to me, mami I swear
I'm seeing things in the dark again*but nobody's there...
So fuck it, let me put you for nothing
So I take a head ...and I hope all of a sudden
... Treaten like ...for nothing of a sudden ...
I'm ready to go and to move
...Whenever I promise give me that song.

I'm lost I my own mind where do I go
I swear this Wonderland is how I like to know ...
Wonderland, twisted up, smoke it in my head
Twisted up, see me jockin if you can in my head, Wonderland
Let me show you, Wonderland
Wonderland, where's my mind I think I lost it in the air.

Take me to the twilight zone
No lights on
To the altitude where you be seein all the kites flown
Convinced on my mind
...My first class right go
Mummy ... I've got a the mouth now
Conversation, why I'm layin on the ground now
About face, ...now, see the revolution ...with the crowds now
So far gone, but I'm not drizzy, creepin' zone, but I'm not busy
Not no bone, ""wait up who is it?"" I don't even know anymore, I swear I went crazy
Well let's talk about the life and the ice in the right hands
Could get you the dream and a nice tan. with the light, 'cause the slice ...soul in the right hand
...Right, ...with my best tight, ... my bare right
Keep me ...try me figure ...my bad line
...Keep in my head tight ... in my head night.

I'm lost I my own ... where do I go
I swear this Wonderland is how I like to know ...
Wonderland, twisted up, smoke it in my head
Wonderland, twisted up, see the ...in my head, Wonderland
Let me show you, Wonderland
Wonderland, I think I lost it in the air"
Machine Gun Kelly,Invincible,"Voices in the air
I hear 'em loud and clear
Telling me to listen
Whispers in my ear
Nothing can compare
I just wanna listen

As my world turns, the heart beats
Not only in my chest, but the heart in the streets
So when they feel this, they feel me
But I can't feel nothin', outside these Dre Beats
I am from the city of people, came from the bottom
Standing on top of what was supposed to be my coffin, what's up?
Except for shows, we are the dead man walkin'
But reflections show this kid's still got it
Better be known I got the throne like I don't know that there's a king
Never grew up around a family because I'm not a human being
And anyone under my bubble that's coming in my spot, for the top
Let 'em have it, 'cause when I leave, the whole world drops
Lace up Kells

I hear voices in the air
I hear it loud and clear
They're telling me to listen
Whispers in my ear
Nothing can compare
I just want to listen
Telling me
I'm invincible
Telling me
I'm invincible
I am

Waking up sweatin' from the stress of being caged out
Everything I write is played out like what is this
Tear the whole page out
Man I come from holes in the wall but they don't know the past
Even if I told them it all they wouldn't know the half
So maybe I fill up my luggage with all these dreams
And pull on my black coat and my black chucks and nothing in my jeans
It's just one, till the day come like Rocky's movie scene
The day I'm on top of the world, look up the screen like this is me,
This is Kells
Crucified by the public without the nails
Do or die in my city but clearly I never failed
Lost myself from the game when I found myself from the cell
And I found myself from the fame when I lost myself in the pills
And you cannot mess with me still, seen the boys and they winnin'
Underdogs of the year, Cleveland boys in the buildin'
What the fuck is a ceiling?
I'm taking us to the top
And when I leave the whole world drops
Lace up Kells

I hear voices in the air
I hear it loud and clear
They're telling me to listen
Whispers in my ear
Nothing can compare
I just wanna listen
Telling me
I'm invincible
Telling me
I'm invincible
I am"

Bummin' a dollar and a dream real shit
Every day I wake, higher than the night before
Blackin' out every night on tour
5 a.m we jump into the pool with our drawers
Till the cops come. Run, run, fuck the law
And I was born to be wild
Sex, rock and roll and weed piles
Runnin' from the oldest seniles
Follow in my steps, then you walkin' a green mile
Trees in my pockets like my denims a greenhouse
Lead my team town?
Tell me what's my age again?
How many hours till I rage again?
This is the story of a young boy and the page we in
Say that he off chasin' fame again
And there he goes... almost... famous bitch

The bittersweet between my teeth
Tryin' to find the in-betweens
Fall back in love eventually
Yeah

Uh, half naked and almost famous
Wild nights and all those places
I be, half naked and almost famous
And when I get up I ain't changin'
Tell the world lace up
Yeah, come rage with the Machine bitch
E.S.T the team bitch
Never got a college degree
Too busy raisin' hell like it was Friday the 13th bitch
Fuck clothes and fuck hoes
Hundred dollars worth of munchies, truckloads
Eighty-nine cent slushy in the cuphold
Don't know where I'm goin', but we gone... what's home?
Maybe I'll just mapquest my dream
And it'll say the address was me
So what I really wanted all along's been camouflaged by deed?
I'm not a pro, I just dogged the lead?
California dreams
Where we sick of boring Cleveland weather man
Wishin' for heat, I guess I need to see the leather man?
Uh, I just wanna be young forever man
Roll the peter pan, light it up and went to Neverland
Mother fucker I'm gone

The bittersweet between my teeth
Tryin' to find the in-betweens
Fall back in love eventually

Every day I wake up to the same shit
In the same house with the same bricks,
In the same clothes with the same kicks
I might as well be in jail caged in.
Starin' at the wall waitin for a change, but
Dad telling me I gotta get a job.
Couldn't pay the bill so the light turned off.
Them Cleveland boys got it hard.
Oh my God, we living like this too long
Just to lose it all in a week.
My people just too strong.
Get it? Me and my boys be gone.
Puffing on weed like it's the lawn.
Me and my boys tired of being here.
That is why we're gone.
They say we wouldn't amount to nothing, huh.
Y'all thought we was bluffing, ha?
Fought every temptation shit, I guess I'm David ruffin huh?
Nowadays, we don't gotta do that dirt, tell my boys they good.
And nowadays my little girl won't have to work, moved her out the hood.
Look man, I been through it all, and I'm a damned if I got this far,
And I let them strip me of message let these haters take my heart.
This for the ones that had it hard, the ones like me, the underdogs.
This for the ones that waited for them clouds to fall, please God let it

Two other states and never bounced in the city.
Shout out to everybody that's proud in the city.
Everybody cheering in the crowd from the city.
Everyone that never had doubts in the city.
'Cause they know I represent what we about in the city.
And I'm still laced up, tell the world that's nothing changed.
Till it's hundred dollar bills in my pocket, then nothings changed.
If my teammate with me, then I don't wanna thang.
Tell them I'll go broke before I run out on my game.

We're killers, we're orphans, we're addicts, we're stealers.
We're shooters so kill us.

Machine Gun Kelly,A Little More,"I scream at the top of my lungs
But my voice couldn't save this home
You're proud of the guns you hold
What's left now, where can we go?

Yo, I had a dream that the world changed
And for a minute there was no pain
Instead of presidents and old sayings
I heard lyrics from Kurt Cobain
Then I wake up to see the world's ill
Ocean's tainted from the oil spills
How many kids have these wars killed?
How many families can't afford bills?
I wish I could let the world know
That it's okay to let the pain show
And even though times seem bad
It always rains before the rainbow

I scream at the top of my lungs
But my voice couldn't save this home
You're proud of the guns you hold
What's left now? Where can we go?

We all need a little more love
(I think we all) We all need a little more love
(We just need) Ooh a little more love
(The world needs) Ooh little more love

In my hood money equals power
And in the world money controls everything we believe in
I can see we're in our darkest hour
'Cause it feels like the government just is as crooked as the police
I spent the weekend catchin' up on the news
A girl committed suicide after she was bullied at school
'Cause some dudes told her she wasn't cool
But you would rather gossip about a famous person breaking the rules
I'm confused, tell me is my life's price worth the jewels?
They told me fight night I'm supposed to lose
Just 'cause in hindsight, they don't like my type
White boy with some rhythm and blues

I scream at the top of my lungs
But my voice couldn't save this home
You're proud of the guns you hold
What's left now, where can we go?

We all need a little more love
(I think we all) We all need a little more love
(We just need) Ooh a little more love
(The world needs) Ooh little more love

You can give up like they tell you
Stop like they tell you
Be scared to dream for the top like they tell you
But I'm tryna tell you, fuck what they tell you

And in these dark times
As a part of a generation they claim can't be saved
It's important to know we're not blind
We see the truth through blue and dark eyes
I would rather die on my feet than live my knees
If I can't live free right now in the world we just need (A little more love)

A little more love
A little more love"

Still remember how that black dress had your curves right
Still remember smokin' just to calm my nerves
Till you had to leave and grabbed your purse, I grabbed first

Lipstick on my neck, whiskey on my breath

Snapback with my city on it, text back with your titties on it.
Levi's put your kitty on it, start Grindin' like the Clipse is on it.

We just letting motherfuckas know we coming
It's real, it's a real motherfuckin' movement
Whether you like it or not
Whether you support it or not
It's a real motherfuckin' movement, man
It's Cleveland man

I am the alpha omega, black flag swinger
Fuck a driveway I'm in airplane hangers
Me and my gang poppin' champagne like players
For all of them days with no lights and no cable
No one can save you, my city's fatal
Make it up out of it how can they hate you?
C-L-E-V-E-L-A-N-D's the greatEST
I'll light this bitch up make it look like its Vegas
We on, mufucker we on
The first one to blow since Bone
Thinking back when I had a back pack full of fat raps
Didn't no one wanna hear my song
Mufucker y'all wrong, mufucker y'all wrong
Made it and I never left home
Where I'm from enemies bust off their shells like King Koopa
Roll through these streets come up gone like Bermuda
I'm just a boy in the hood like I'm Cuba
So soon as I moved out I bought me a Ruger
You come to my house you blow loud as a tuba
I bring your bitch here, she'll go down like a scuba
All of y'all shits out of style like a scooter
Put all of y'all shits in the ditch like a sewer
Make all of y'all bow like my name is Anubis
Talk out your medulla get hit with bazookas

I am the alpha, I am the omega
(Ah!)
I am the alpha, I am the omega
(Ay!)
I am the alpha, I am the omega

If you ain't living your life then you're dead
And sleep is its cousin so I shot my bed
Paranoia got me using these meds
Now I'm Smokey as Chris on a Friday like Craig
Retract that statement, I'm stoney as Fred
Evacuate when my homies get mad
You better pray to your God for a blessing
Before they make your world look like Armageddon
Knew I was trouble since I was 11
Ripped up my jeans and I bought me a leather
My friends saw me as a King like Coretta
My dad saw his son as a nuisance, a rebel, and (ah!)
My music sounds like the devil
Turn that shit off or get out of my temple
Right after that he'd go back to his Kettle One vodka
And drink it all up till he's mental
I have no issue, I am official
Let them come at me I practice Jiu Jitsu
Only fear two things with three letters dawg
That's G-O-D, God and my fucking initials
Doctors called up to the news to report to them what they discovered
Said I'm the first of a species that they call a real motherfucker, (Kells)
And I'm sorry if you get a lot of hits from all my followers
If you acknowledge us in any other way then positive
But you shouldn't be hollering or talking about Superman
When you're living in Metropolis
And if you follow astronomy I'm a Taurus
That means I don't give a fuck what you thought of me
I walk into an interview looking like a lobotomy
Flipping my middle finger at everybody who watching us, (uh)
Fuck that bring the beat back
Kill this instrumental leave the body where the reef at
Nah, fuck that where the keef at
Sprinkle a little bit on a quarter of my weed sack
Give me a minute I took a hit I'm tryna focus like astigmatism
My competition on my dick, they're like the zip on my denim
They want the heat I light 'em up like I put cigarettes in 'em
You bitch, what's your religion?
I wanna know what God you're seeing in a couple of seconds
I wanna see the criticism bout my lyricism
When I'm in your face rippin' this rhythm up like cannibalism
It's Kells

Machine Gun Kelly,Bad Things - With Camila Cabello,"Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say, it's complicated
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated

Nothing's that bad
If it feels good
So you come back
Like I knew you would
And we're both wild
And the night's young
And you're my drug
Breathe you in 'til my face numb
Drop it down to that bass drum
I got what you dream about
Nails scratchin' my back tatt
Eyes closed while you scream out
And you keep me in with those hips
While my teeth sink in those lips
While your body's giving me life
And you suffocate in my kiss
Then you said

I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever

Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say, it's complicated
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated

I can't explain it
I love the pain
And I love the way your breath
Numbs me of Novocaine
And we are
Always high
Keep it strange
Okay, yeah, I'm insane
But you the same
Let me paint the picture
Couch by the kitchen
Nothin' but your heels on
Losin' our religion
You're my pretty little vixen
And I'm the voice inside your head
That keeps telling you to listen to all the bad things I say
And you said

I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever

Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say, it's complicated
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated

The way we love, is so unique
And when we touch, I'm shivering
And no one has to get it
Just you and me
'Cause we're just living
Between the sheets

I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever

Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it

Don't matter what you say

Eminem,Not Afraid,"I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid) (Yeah) to take a stand (to take a stand) (It's been a ride)
Everybody (I guess I had to) (everybody), come take my hand (Go to that place) (come take my hand) (To get to this one)
We'll walk this road together (Now some of you) through the storm
Whatever weather (Might still be in that place) cold or warm (If you're tryin to get out)
Just lettin' you know that, you're not alone (Just follow me)
Holla if you feel like (I'll get you there) you've been down the same road

You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper, before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words, before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin' I do it, I don't give a damn

What you think, I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world feed it beans
It's gassed up, if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who looked down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony

No if ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album, he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him

Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a ""fuck you"" for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the earth, he's got the urge
To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid) to take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody), come take my hand (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

OK quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm, for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth, for that
Fuck your feelin's, instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped

And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact
Let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was eh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground

Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack-bloww
'Cause I ain't playin' around, there's a game called circle
And I don't know how, I'm way too up to back down

But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud
Still follows me around, but it's time to exorcise these demons
These motherfuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid) to take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody), come take my hand (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like, you've been down the same road

And I just can't keep livin' this way
So startin' today, I'm breakin' out of this cage
I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, believe me you

I been through the ringer, but they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead, no more beef flingers

No more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it

'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
'Cause I'm raisin' the bar, I shoot for the moon
But I'm too busy gazin' at stars, I feel amazin' and I'm not

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid) to take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody), come take my hand (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like, you've been down the same road"
Eminem,The Monster,"I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You trying to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone, public excuse me

Been wanting my cake and eat it too, wanting it both ways
Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
When I blew seep it was confusing
'Cause all I wanted to do is be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf

Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Ooh, hit the lottery, oh wee
With what I gave up to get was bittersweet
It was like winning a huge meet

Ironic 'cause I think I'm getting so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginning to lose sleep, one sheep, two sheep
Going cuckoo and cuckier as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, 'cause I'm

Rihanna:
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You trying to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

Well, that's nothing
Well, that's nothing

Eminem:
Now I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it
'Cause you never know when it could all be over

Tomorrow so I keep conjuring
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
(Yeah, ponder it, Do you want this?
No wonder you're losing your mind, the way it wanders.)

Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo!
I think you've been wandering off
Down yonder and stumbled upon Jeff VanVonderen

'Cause I needed an intervention in this
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
'Cause the very things that I love is killing me and I can't conquer it

My OCD is conking me in the head
Keep knocking, nobody's home, I'm sleepwalking
I'm just relaying what the voice of my head saying
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the

Rihanna:
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You trying to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

Well, that's nothing
Well, that's nothing

Eminem:
Call me crazy but I had this vision
One day that I'd walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then drums get killed
I'm coming straight at MCs, blood get spilled

And I take it back to the days that I get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that
Pumped the feelin' and shit that say back
To the kids who played 'em
I ain't here to save the fucking children, but if one kid

Out of a hundred million
Who are going through a struggle feels it and relates that's great
It's payback, Russell Wilson falling way back in the draft
Turn nothing into something, still can make that
Straw in the gold chump I will spend Rumpelstiltskin in a hay stack

Maybe I need a straitjacket, face facts
I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
It's nothing, I'm still friends with the

Rihanna:
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You trying to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

Get along with the voices inside of my head
You trying to save me, stop holding your breath

Eminem,Rap God,"Look, I was gonna go easy on you, not to hurt your feelings
But I'm only going to get this one chance
Something's wrong, I can feel it (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)
Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble – big trouble
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances
You are just what the doc ordered

I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slapbox, slapbox?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rapbot

But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit

Made a living and a killing off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nut-sack
I'm an MC still as honest

But as rude and indecent as all hell
Syllables skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This slickety-gippety-hippity-hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissing match with this rappity-rap
Packing a MAC in the back of the Ac, backpack rap, yap-yap, yacketty-yack

And now at the exact same time
I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half

Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs, feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are having a rough time period, here's a maxi-pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece, yeah

'Cause I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slapbox, slapbox?
Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard

Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the earth like an asteroid, I did nothing but shoot for the moon since
*pew*

MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to bust a rhyme
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N-
-W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim

Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up, and be in a position
To meet Run-D.M.C. and induct them into the motherfuckin' Rock n'
Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game till I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?
Little gay looking boy

So gay I can barely say it with a straight face looking boy
You witnessing a massacre
Like you watching a church gathering take place looking boy
Oy vey, that boy's gay, that's all they say looking boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a way to go from your label everyday looking boy
Hey, looking boy, what you say looking boy?
I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre looking boy
I'mma work for everything I have
Never asked nobody for shit, get out my face looking boy
Basically boy you're never gonna be capable
Of keeping up with the same pace looking boy

'Cause I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racing around the track, call me Nascar, Nascar
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton, no Asgard, Asgard

So you be Thor and I'll be Odin, you rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off then I'm reloading immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walking dead, but I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating
But I got your mom deep throating

I'm out my Ramen noodle, we have nothing in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though

For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
Enough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground, but I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind

So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come trying to censor you
Like that one line I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP
One where I tried to say I'd take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm

Morphin' into an immortal coming through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows
You write normal, fuck being normal
And I just bought a new raygun from the future

To just come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Maywhether’s pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh, man, that was the 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day
""Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you""
Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed, JJ Fad

Uh, sama lamaa duma lamaa you assuming I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber
So that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
Oh, he's too mainstream
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
It's not hip-hop, it's pop, 'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it

I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I’m ripping any one of these verses diverse as you
It’s curtains, I’m inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to prove
That if you were half as nice, your songs and you could sacrifice virgins too

School flunky, pill junky
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues
But it's still tongue and cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel, I'm asleep in the front seat
Bumping Heavy D. & The Boyz, still chunky, but funky
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me

They asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I had
Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation
Understand the discrimination

But fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then
But if I can't batter the women how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake it for Satan
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas
And take a vacation to trip a broad
And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard
Be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a God?"
Eminem,Love The Way You Lie,"Rihanna:
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Eminem:
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe but I still fight, while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight

High off her love, drunk from her hate, it's like I'm huffin' paint
And I love her the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates
Me, she fucking hates me and I love it, wait

Where you going, I'm leaving you, no you ain't
Come back, we're running right back here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's going good it's going great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane

But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped ""who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

Rihanna:
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Eminem:
You ever love somebody so much, you can barely breathe when you're with 'em
You meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah them chills used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em

You'd swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em
Now you're in each others' face, spewing venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push pull each others' hair, scratch claw bit 'em
Throw 'em down pin 'em, so lost in them moments when you're in 'em

It's the rage that took over, it controls ya both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over

But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again, now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

Rihanna:
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Eminem:
Now I know we said things, did things, that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
But when it comes to love, you're just as blinded, baby please

Come back, it wasn't you, baby it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though

Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall

Next time, there will be no next time, I apologize
Even though I know it's lies, I'm tired of the games
I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire

Rihanna:
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie"
Eminem,'Till I Collapse,"'Cause sometimes you just feel tired,
Feel weak, and when you feel weak, you feel like you wanna just give up.
But you gotta search within you, you gotta find that inner strength
And just pull that shit out of you and get that motivation to not give up
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse.

Yo left, yo left, yo left right left
Yo left, yo left, yo left right left
Yo left, yo left, yo left right left
Yo left, yo left, yo left right left

Till I collapse I’m spilling these raps long as you feel 'em
Till the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing them
'Cause when I am not then I'ma stop penning 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I’m just not Eminem.
Subliminal thoughts when I'm stop sending them women are caught in webs spin and hauk venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illing to stop.
Amoxacilin is just not real enough.
The criminal cop killing hip-hop filling a minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners.
You're coming with me, feel it or not you’re gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of god lives in us.
You hear it a lot, lyrics that shock is it a miracle or am I just a product of pop fizzing up.
For sizzle my whizzle this is the plot listen up you bizzles forgot slizzle does not give a fuck.

Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps.
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps.
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.

Music is like magic there’s a certain feeling you get when you're real
And you spit and people are feeling your shit.
This is your moment and every single minute you spend trying to hold onto it
'cause you may never get it again.
So while you’re in it try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over just admit when it's at its end.
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half this shit that gets in.
I got a list here's the order of my list that it's in.
It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie, Andre from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me.
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy, so when I’m not put on this list the shit does not offend me.
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's bothering me.
Even though half you people got a fucking problem with me.
You hate it but you know respect you've got to give me
The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney. Nate hit me.

Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps.
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps.
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.

Soon as a verse starts I eat it at MC’s heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me? Smart.
And it's absurd how people hang on every word.
I’ll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I’ll never be served my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave earth that would be the death of me first.
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse.
That’s why I’m clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I’m an addict
I rap like I’m addicted to smack like I’m Kim Mathers.
But I don’t want to go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers.
So this is like a full blown attack I’m launching at them
The track is on some battling raps who want some static
'Cause I don’t really think that the fact that I’m Slim matters
A plaque of platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest.

Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps.
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps.
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.

Until the roof (Until the roof)
The roof comes off (The roof comes off)
Until my legs (Until my legs)
Give out from underneath me (Give out form underneath me)

I, I will not fall,
I will stand tall,
Feels like no one can beat me."

So unforgettable

When the story gets told

Stand by me

I want you hear with mee"
Linkin Park,Good Goodbye (feat. Pusha T and Stormzy),"So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)

Live from the rhythm, it's
Something wild, venomous
Enemies trying to read me
You're all looking highly illiterate
Blindly forgetting if I'm in the mix
You won't find an equivalent
I've been here killing it
Longer than you've been alive, you idiot
And it makes you so mad
Somebody else could be stepping in front of you
And it makes you so mad that you're not the only one
There's more than one of you
And you can't understand the fact
That it's over and done, hope you had fun
You've got a lot to discuss on the bus
Headed back where you're from

So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
Good goodbye

Pusha T:
Goodbye, good riddance
A period is after every sentence
Did my time with my cellmate
Maxed out so now we finished
Every day was like a hail date
Every night was like a hailstorm
Took her back to my tinted windows
Showin' out, she in rare form
Wings up, now I'm airborne
King Push, they got a chair for him
Make way for the new queen
The old lineup, where they cheer for 'em
Consequence when you ain't there for him
Were you there for him?
Did you care for him?
You were dead wrong

(Don't you come back no more)
So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)

Stormzy:
Yo
Let me say goodbye to my demons
Let me say goodbye to my past life
Let me say goodbye to the darkness
Tell 'em that I'd rather be here in the starlight
Tell 'em that I'd rather be here where they love me
Tell 'em that I'm yours, this is our life
And I still keep raising the bar like
Never seen a young black brother in the chart twice
Goodbye to the stereotypes
You can't tell my kings we can't
Mandem we're linking tings in parks
Now I gotta tune with Linkin Park
Like goodbye to my old hoes
Goodbye to the cold roads
I can't die for my postcode
Young little Mike from the Gold Coast
And now I'm inside with my bro bros
Gang

So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
Good goodbye

Good goodbye
Good goodbye

5 Seconds of Summer,Amnesia,"I drove by all the places we used to hang out getting wasted
I thought about our last kiss, how it felt the way you tasted
And even know your friends tell me you're doing fine
Are you somewhere feeling lonely even know he's right beside you?
When he says those words that hurt you, do you read the ones I wrote you?

Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?

'Cause I'm not fine at all

I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the makeup running down your face
And the dreams you left behind, you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
'Cause I'm not fine at all

The pictures that you sent me, they're still living in my phone
I'll admit I like to see them, I'll admit I feel alone
All my friends keep asking why I'm not around
It hurts to know you're happy and it hurts that you've moved on
It's hard to hear your name when I haven't seen you in so long

Miley Cyrus,Party In The U.S.A.,"I hopped off the plane at LAX
With a dream and my cardigan
Welcome to the land of fame excess (whoa)
Am I gonna fit in?
Jumped in the cab, here I am for the first time
Look to my right, and I see the Hollywood sign
This is all so crazy
Everybody seems so famous

My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio 
And a Jay-Z song was on
And a Jay-Z song was on
And a Jay-Z song was on

So I put my hands up
They're playing my song
The butterflies fly away
I’m noddin’ my head like, yeah
Movin’ my hips like, yeah
Got my hands up
They're playing my song
They know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A.
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A.

Get to the club in my taxi cab
Everybody's looking at me now
Like, ""Who's that chick that's rockin' kicks?
She gotta be from out of town""
So hard with my girls not around me
It's definitely not a Nashville party
'Cause all I see are stilettos
I guess I never got the memo

My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the DJ dropped my favorite tune
And a Britney song was on
And a Britney song was on

So I put my hands up

They know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A.
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A.

Feel like hopping on a flight (on a flight)
Back to my hometown tonight (town tonight)
Something stops me every time (every time)
The DJ plays my song and I feel alright

So I put my hands up
They're playing my song
The butterflies fly away
I’m noddin’ my head like, yeah (noddin' my head)
Movin’ my hips like, yeah (ooh yeah)

Hoobastank,The Reason,"I'm not a perfect person
There's many things I wish I didn't do
But I continue learning
I never meant to do those things to you
And so I have to say before I go
That I just want you to know

I've found a reason for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
And the reason is you

I'm sorry that I hurt you
It's something I must live with everyday
And all the pain I put you through
I wish that I could take it all away
And be the one who catches all your tears
That's why I need you to hear

I've found a reason for me
To change who I used to be

Out on the terrace

While I'm wasted with someone else""

Standing there with a frown and a cigarette
Posting pictures of yourself on the internet
Out on the terrace
We breathe in the air of this small town
On our own cuttin' class for the thrill of it
Getting drunk on the past we were livin' in

Ed Sheeran,The A Team,"White lips, pale face, breathing in snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, day's end, struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men

And they say she's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream, been this way since 18
But lately her face seems slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries, they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

'Cause we're just under the upperhand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight

And in a pipe she flies to the motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside for angels to fly
Angels to fly

Ripped gloves, raincoat, tried to swim, stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes, weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone

And they say she's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream, been this way since 18
But lately her face seems slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries, they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

'Cause we're just under the upperhand
And go mad for a couple grams
But she don't want to go outside tonight

And in a pipe she flies to the motherland
Sells love to another man
It's too cold outside for angels to fly

An angel will die, covered in white
Closed eye and hoping for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line

And they say she's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream, been this way since 18
But lately her face seems slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries, they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

And we're all under the upper hand
Go mad for a couple grams
And we don't want to go outside tonight

In a pipe, fly to the motherland
Or sell love to another man
It's too cold outside for angels to fly
Angels to fly

To fly, fly
For angels to fly
To fly, to fly
Angels to die"
Ed Sheeran,One,"Tell me that you turned down the man
Who asked for your hand
'Cause you're waiting for me
And I know, you're gonna be away a while
But I've got no plans at all to leave
And would you take away my hopes and dreams?
Just stay with me

All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
'Cause you are the only one

Take my hand and my
Heart and soul, I will
Only have these eyes for you
And you know, everything changes but
We'll be strangers if, we see this through
You could stay within these walls and bleed
But just stay with me

All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
'Cause you are the only one

I'm stumbling off drunk, getting myself lost
I am so gone, so tell me the way home
I listen to sad songs, singing about love
And where it goes wrong

All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
'Cause you are the only one"
Ed Sheeran,Sing,"It's late in the evening
Glass on the side
I've been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignoring everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
I don't wanna know
If you're getting ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no man's land
For the longest time lady

I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe

Sing
Louder
Sing

This love is ablaze
I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then we got nothing to say and nothing to know
But something to drink and maybe something to smoke
Let it go until our roads are changed
Singing ""We Found Love"" in a local rave, no
I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out and hope and pray
I told her my name and said ""it's nice to meet ya""
Then she handed me of a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know if she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness
I'm in deep if anybody finds out
I'm meant to drive home but I drunk all of it down
Not sober enough we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another now she's kissing my mouth

I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe

Sing
Louder
Sing

Can you feel it?
All the guys in here don't even wanna dance
Can you feel it?
All that I can hear is music from the back
Can you feel it?
Found you hiding here so I hoped you'd take my hand darling

Before the beats kicks in again
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe

Ed Sheeran,Nina,"I met you when I was a teen
But then you were one as well
And I could play a guitar
Just like ringing a bell
Sometimes I wonder
In any other summer
Could you have been a part time lover to me
Listening to Stevie Wonder
Under the covers where we used to lay
And Re: Stacks is what the speakers played
I'd be on tour almost every day
When I was home up in my flat is where we used to stay

Just watching a DVD, smoking illegal weed
Getting high as two kites when we needed to breathe
We'd use each other's air just for the people to see
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep
We'd go anywhere our minds would take us
And I'll say you were beautiful without your make up
And you don't even need to worry about your weight cause
We can all be loved the way that God made us
And time's the only reason that we could break up
Cause you would always tell me I'm away too much
Distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane or make a mistake
So say it again

Oh Nina, you should go Nina
'Cause I ain't ever coming home Nina
Oh won't you leave me now
And I've been livin' on the road Nina
But then again you should know Nina
Cause that's you and me both Nina
Oh won't you leave me now, now

And every weekend in the winter you'd be wearing my hoodie
With drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold
Taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own
Cause every day when I was away we'd only speak on the phone
Watching blue planet, creating new habits
Acting as if we were two rabbits
And then you'd vanish
Back to the burrow with all the Celtics
I'd disappear, you'd call me selfish
I understand but I can't help it
I put my job over everything except my family and friends
But you'll be in between forever so I guess we'll have to take a step back
Overlook the situation cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications
And I'm not saying we should be taking a break
Just revaluate quick before we make a mistake and it's too late
So we can either deal with the pain and wait to get on a plane
But in a day we'll have to say it again

Oh Nina, you should go Nina
'Cause I ain't ever coming home Nina
Oh won't you leave me now
And I've been livin' on the road Nina
But then again you should know Nina
Cause that's you and me both Nina
Oh won't you leave me now, now

Love will come and love will go
But you can make it on your own
Sing that song
Go oh won't you leave me now
People grow and fall apart
But you can mend your broken heart
Take it back go oh won't you leave me now

x2:
Oh Nina, you should go Nina (Love will come and Love will go)
'Cause I ain't ever coming home Nina (But you can make it on your own)
Oh won't you leave me now (Sing that song, go oh won't you leave me now)
And I've been livin' on the road Nina (People grow and fall apart)
But then again you should know Nina (But you can mend your broken heart)
Cause that's you and me both Nina (Take it back, go oh won't you leave me now)
Oh won't you leave me now

Ed Sheeran,Tenerife Sea,"You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
The way it falls on the side of your neck
Down your shoulders and back

We are surrounded by all of these lies
And people who talk too much
You've got that kind of look in your eyes
As if no one knows anything but us

And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need

I'm so in love, so in love
So in love, so in love

You look so beautiful in this light
Your silhouette over me
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
Is the Tenerife Sea

And all of the voices surrounding us here
They just fade out when you take a breath
Just say the word and I will disappear
Into the wilderness

And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need

I'm so in love, so in love
So in love, so in love

Lumière, darling
Lumière over me
Lumière, darling
Lumière over me
Lumière, darling
Lumière over me

So in love, love, love, love,
So in love

And in the moment I knew you back"
Ed Sheeran,Runaway,"I've known it for a long time
Daddy wakes up to a drink at night
Disappearing all night
I don't wanna know where he's been lying
I know what I wanna do
I wanna run away
Run away with you
Gonna grab clothes, six in the morning, go

How long you leavin'?
Well dad just don't expect me back this evening
Oh it could take a bit of time to heal this
It's been a long day
Almost out of the wrong way
But I love him from the skin to my bones
But I don't wanna live in his home
There's nothing to say 'cause he knows
I'll just run away and be on my own

I've never seen my dad cry
Cold as stone, and the kitchen light
I'd tell you it's about time
But I was raised to keep quiet
And this is what I'm gonna do
Gonna run away, gonna make that move
Gonna grab clothes, and when it's morning, go

How long you leavin'?
Well dad just don't expect me back this evening
Oh it could take a bit of time to heal this
It's been a long day
Almost out of the wrong way
But I love him from the skin to my bones
But I don't wanna live in his home
There's nothing to say 'cause he knows
I'll just run away in the overnight

Back pack, and a flat cap, turned to the back
'Cause I packed my clothes up
My dad was a man without plans of attack and tends to show that
I don't wanna live this way
Gonna take my things and go
If things change in a matter of days
I could be persuaded to hold up
And mama was the same
None of us are saints
I guess that God knows that
I don't wanna run away
And one of these days I might just show that
Put my home in a suitcase
Tie both shoelaces and hope that
Things change, but for now I leave town with a backpack on my shoulder

But I love him from the skin to my bones
But I don't wanna live in his home
There's nothing to say 'cause he knows
I'll just run away and be on my own"
Ed Sheeran,The Man,"Now I don't wanna hate you
Just wish you'd never gone for the man
And waited two weeks at least
Before you let him take you
I stayed true
I kind of knew you liked the dude from private school
He's waiting for the time to move
I knew he had his eyes on you
He's not the right guy for you
Don't hate me 'cause I write the truth
No I would never lie to you
But it was never fine to lose you
And what a way to find out
It never came from my mouth
You never changed your mind
But you were just afraid to mind out
But fuck it, I won't be changing the subject I love it
I'll make your little secret public it's nothing
I'm just disgusted with the skeletons you sleep with in your closet to get back at me
Trapped and I'm lacking sleep
Fact is you're mad at me because I backtrack so casually
You're practically my family
If we married then I'll guess you'd have to be
But tragically our love just lost the will to live
But would I kill to give it one more shot
I think not

I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no
Anymore
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no
Anymore

Recently I tend to zone out
Up in my headphones to Holocene
You promised your body but I'm away so much
I stay more celibate than in a monastery
I'm not cut out for life on the road
'Cause I didn't know I'd miss you this much
And at the time we'd just go, so sue me
I guess I'm not the man that you need
Ever since you went to uni
I've been sofa surfing with a rucksack
Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad
But when I broke the industry
That's when I broke your heart
I was supposed to chart and celebrate
But good things are over fast
I know it's hard to deal with and see this
I tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features
Then I turn the music off
And all I'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces, Jesus
I never really want to believe this
Got advice from my dad and he
Told me that family is all I'll ever have and need
I guess I'm unaware of it
Success is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with

I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no
Anymore
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no
Anymore

And since you left, I've given up my days off
It's what I need to stay strong
I know you have a day job but mine is 24/7
I feel like writing a book, I guess I lied in the hook
'Cause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could
The irony is if my career and music didn't exist
In 6 years, yeah, you'd probably be my wife with a kid
I'm frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink
And lighting a spliff I fall into a spiral and it's
Just hiding my misguiding thoughts that I'm trying to kill
And I'd be writing my will before I'm 27, I'll die from a thrill
Go down in history as just a wasted talent
Can I face the challenge, or did I make a mistake erasing?
It's only therapy, my thoughts just get ahead of me
Eventually I'll be fine I know that it was never meant to be
Either way I guess I'm not prepared, but I'll say this
These things happen for a reason and you can't change shit
Take my apology, I'm sorry for the honesty
But I had to get this off my chest

I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no
Anymore
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no
Anymore"
Ed Sheeran,Afire Love,"Things were all good yesterday
And then the devil took your memory
And if you fell to your death today
I hope that heaven is your resting place
I heard the doctors put your chest in pain
But then that could have been the medicine
And now you're lying in the bed again
Either way I'll cry with the rest of them.

And my father told me, ""Son,
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face,
And you're not the only one.
Although my grandma used to say, he used to say...

Darling hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside for a little while he wrote
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light, in life, in love.
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together oh
With your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight, we're afire love, love, love oh.

Things were all good yesterday
And then the devil took your breath away
And now we're left here in the pain,
Black suit, black tie standing in the rain.
And now my family is one again,
Stapled together with the strangers and the friend.
Came to my mind I should paint it with a pen.
6 years old I remember when my father told me, ""Son,
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face,
And you're not the only one.
Although my grandma used to say, he used to say...

Darling hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside for a little while he wrote
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light, in life, in love.
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together oh
With your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight, we're afire love, love, love oh.'
See the love the love the love the love
See the love the love the love the love
See the love the love the love the love

And my father and all of my family rise from the seats to sing Hallelujah

And my brother and all my family rise from the seats to sing Hallelujah

(And all my brothers and my sisters yeah)

And my brother and all of my family rise from the seats to sing Hallelujah

See the love the love the love the love
See the love the love the love the love
See the love the love the love the love"
Ed Sheeran,Take It Back,"I'm not a rapper; I'm a singer with a flow
I've got a habit of spitting
Quicker lyrics you know
You found me ripping the writtens
Out of the pages they sit in
And never once I get bitten
Because plagiarism is hidden
Which I would sit on the rhythm
Prisoner with a vision
Signs of a label, but didn't listen to any criticism
Thought you knew but you didn't
So perk your ears up and listen
Studio is a system
And you could say that I'm driven
And now it's on to the next saga
We drink the best lager
I never tried to win you over
Like your stepfather
I do my own thing now, and get respect after
And I'm avoiding cocaine like it was Get Carter
For four years I never had a place to stay
But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight
At 16 years old, yeah I moved out of my home
I was Macy Gray I tried to say goodbye and I choked
To make from sleeping at the subway station
To sleeping with a Movie star and adding to the population
Not my imagination, I don't wanna relax
Would it hurt your reputation
If I put it on wax?
I'll take it back now...

Mmmm c'mon and take it back love,
C'mon and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love
No

Take it back with the rhythm and blues
With my rap pack I'll be singing the news,
Trying to act like Jack Black when I bring 'em to school
I'll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop,
Bringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes,
I give you the truth through the vocal booth,
Stars burst out on the scene like an opal fruit,
They try and take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot,
But then again that's what they're supposed to do,
And I'm supposed to be calm,
I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm,
Whispering everything that happens is from now on,
I'll be ready to start again at the end of the song,
Still their claiming that I handled it wrong,
But then I never had an enemy, except for NME,
But I'll be selling twice as many copies as the magazines will ever be,
With only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees,
I'm healthier than a Dalmatian on Pedigree,
Singing for the masses,
Rubber dinghy rapids,
Keep this rapping a habit
And keep on passioning magic,
I'm battling for respect,
I don't know if I'll have it,
This songs from the heart,
Cover the planet
I'll take it back now

Mmmm c'mon and take it back love,
C'mon and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love
No

Take it back now
Now I don't ever want to be perfect,
'Cause I'm a singer that you
Never want to see shirtless
And I accept the fact that someone has to win worst-dressed,
Taking my first steps into the scene,
Giving me focus
Putting on a brave face, like Timothy Dalton
Considering a name change,
Thinking it was hopeless
Rhyming over recordings
Avoiding tradition
Cause every day some lyrics
And a melody can be written
Now absence can make your heart break
But drinking absinthe can change your mind-state, vividly,
I need to let my liver be
And I say it again,
Living life on the edge,
With a closed hand full of friends
Is good advice from a man
Who took his life on the road with me
And I hope to see him blowing up globally
Cause that's how it's supposed to be
I'm screaming out vocally
It might seem totally impossible
Achieving life's dreams
But, but I just write schemes
I'm never having a stylist, giving me tight jeans
Madison Square Garden is where I might be
But more likely,
You'll find me in the back
Room of a dive bar with my mates
Having a pint with McDaid
Discussing records we made
And every single second knowing
That we'll never betray
The way we were raised
Remembering our background
Sat down
That's how we plan it out;
It's time to take it back now

Mmmm c'mon and take it back love,
C'mon and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love
No

Mmmm c'mon and take it back love,
C'mon and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love
No

My dreams keep me awake at night
Written in rhymes, till I deliver the hype
Am I just living the lie
With this you must know that the number's just sold whoa
Will keep me going through the tough times, dream with me
We forget 90 per cent of it when we wake
But the other 10 per cent it never fades
Dreaming dreams, day to day goals
Stay awake loads, try to make the cut like the
Paper or razor blade, oh, never give up
And just remember just to hold out more
A couple years ago
I couldn't just control that thought
You'd find me buskin' on the street
When it was cold outdoors
And now I'm sweating on the stage of a sold out tour
Writing love songs for the sake of it
Never to make a hit
You can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick
I'm not a rapper I'm a singer, I just take the piss and
Most of these other guys are kids that pose
His little sister has to babysit, that's just a way it is
Dreams you own, just set your goals
And have the utmost faith in it; tread your own path
You'll never make it as a follower, you'll never know
Where you will go or where you will be tomorrow"
Ed Sheeran,Shirtsleeves,"I can taste salt water
And if I blink again
You'll be sinking in
So we'll learn to swim in the ocean
You made to hold ya
And you think of him
And pretty soon you'll be floating away
And I'll hold on to the words you spoke of
Anchored down in my throat, love
And I'm captain of this sinking boat, now
We just want all men to carry me home
The saltedness won't dry
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
These hearts will be fully tonight
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes, you eyes

I still taste salt water
Oh my lips from your kiss bitterness
And I drown within the ocean you made
And I hate to love you, these cuffs cover in your make up
I'll never trust you again
You can just be a friend
And I'll hold on to the words you spoke of
Anchored down in my throat, love
And I'm captain of this sinking boat, now
We just want all men to carry me home
The saltedness won't dry
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
These hearts will be fully tonight
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
Your eyes, your lips, your mouth
Your thighs, your back, you drive me wild
Tonight, the fact design
I'm on my way home
On the way home
I lied, I tried to cry but I'm drowning in the ocean you made

The saltedness won't dry
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
These hearts will be fully tonight
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes, you eyes"
Ed Sheeran,Even My Dad Does Sometimes,"It's all right to cry
Even my dad does sometimes
So don't wipe your eyes
Tears remind you you're alive
It's all right to die
'Cause death's the only thing you haven't tried
But just for tonight hold on

So live life like you're giving all
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tell me your path

It's all right to shake
Even my hand does sometimes
So inside the rage
Against the dying of the light
It's all right to say that death's the only thing you haven't tried
But just for today hold on

So live life like you're giving all
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tell me your path

Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tell me your path
And hold on"
Harry Styles,Sign of the Times,"Just stop your crying
It's a sign of the times
Welcome to the final show
Hope you're wearing your best clothes
You can't bribe the door on your way to the sky
You look pretty good down here
But you ain't really good

If we never learn, we been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets?
The bullets
We never learn, we been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets?

Just stop your crying
It's a sign of the times
We gotta get away from here
We gotta get away from here
Just stop your crying
It will be all right
They told me that the end is near
We gotta get away from here

Just stop crying
Have the time of your life
Breaking through the atmosphere
And things are pretty good from here
Remember everything will be all right
We can meet again somewhere
Somewhere far away from here

If we never learn, we been here before

Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets?

We don't talk enough
We should open up
Before it's all too much
Will we ever learn?
We've been here before
It's just what we know

Stop your crying baby
It's a sign of the times
We gotta get away
We got to get away

We got to get away
We got to get away
We got to, we got to
We got to, we got to

Ed Sheeran,"You Need Me, I Don't Need You","Now I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That's you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus, as I sing to you loud
And I can't, no, I won't hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now

See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me

'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me

I sing and write my own tune
And I write my own verse? Hell
Don't need another word-smith to make my tune sell?
Call yourself a singer-writer. You're just bluffing
Your name's on the credits and you didn't write nothing
I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to Brit School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe

And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
And musically I'm demonstrating
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the Enterprise when some fella filmed me
""A young singer-writer like Gabriella Cilmi""

'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me

'Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop till my name's in light
At Stadium Heights with Damien Rice
On red carpets, now I'm on Arabian nights
Because I'm young and all my brothers gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I'm gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter
The games over but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal

People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows
But I haven't got a house plus I live on the couch
So you can be the lyrics when I'm singing them out (wow!)

From day one, I've been prepared
With vo5 wax for my ginger hair
So now I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of what the future holds
'Cause it's another day
Plus I'll keep my last name forever keep the genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rappers shoes using new laces
Selling cds from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling cds from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide till we're Just Jack, soon as I get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the moustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago
But more people hear me though
According to the myspace and youtube videos
I'm always doing shows, if I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up call me *Ruffio
Melody music maker
Reading all the papers
They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator

Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you"

Mariah Carey,I Want To Know What Love Is,"I gotta take a little time
A little time to think things over
I better read between the lines
In case I need it when I'm colder, hey

In my life, there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life

I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
I know you can show me

I'm gonna take a little time (take a little time)
A little time to look around me
I've got nowhere left to hide (nowhere left to hide)
It looks like love has finally found me

In my life, there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
I can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life

I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
And I know you can show me
Show me
I wanna know

I wanna know what love is (I wanna know)
I want you to show me (and I'm feeling so much love)
I want to feel what love is
And I know you can show me

I wanna know what love is (Let's talk about love)

Linkin Park,Burning In The Skies,"I used the dead wood to make the fire rise
The blood of innocents burning in the skies
I filled my cup with the risin' of the sea
And poured it out in an ocean of debris

Oh, I'm swimming in the smoke of bridges I have burned
So don't apologize, I'm losing what I don't deserve
What I don't deserve

We held our breath when the clouds began to form
But you were lost in the beating of the storm
But in the end, we were made to be apart
Like separate chambers of the human heart

No, I'm swimming in the smoke of bridges I have burned
So don't apologize, I'm losing what I don't deserve
It's in the blackened bones of bridges I have burned
So don't apologize, I'm losing what I don't deserve
What I don't deserve

I'm swimming in the smoke of bridges I have burned
So don't apologize, I'm losing what I don't deserve
The blame is mine alone for bridges I have burned
So don't apologize, I'm losing what I don't deserve
What I don't deserve
What I don't deserve, oh
What I don't deserve

Linkin Park,Empty Spaces,Instrumental
Linkin Park,Waiting For The End,"Yeah, yo
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
Just a voice like a riot rocking every revision
But you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm
And though the words sound steady, something empty's within 'em

We say ""Yeah"", with fists flying up in the air
Like we're holding onto something that's invisible there
'Cause we're living at the mercy of the pain and the fear
Until we dead it, forget it, let it all disappear (yeah)

Waiting for the end to come, wishing I had strength to stand
This is not what I had planned, it's out of my control
Flying at the speed of light, thoughts were spinning in my head
So many things were left unsaid, it's hard to let you go

I know what it takes to move on
I know how it feels to lie
All I wanna do is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

Sitting in an empty room, trying to forget the past
This was never meant to last, I wish it wasn't so

I know what it takes to move on
I know how it feels to lie
All I wanna do is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

Yo, yeah
What was left when that fire was gone?
I thought it felt right but that right was wrong
All caught up in the eye of the storm
I'm trying to figure out what it's like moving on

And I don't even know what kind of things I said
My mouth kept moving and my mind went dead
So, picking up the pieces now, where to begin?
The hardest part of ending is starting again

All I wanna do is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

This is not the end, this is not the beginning
Just a voice like a riot rocking every revision
(I'm holding on to what I haven't got)
But you listen to the tone and the violet rhythm
Though the words sound steady, something empty's within 'em

We say ""Yeah"", with fists flying up in the air
Like we're holding onto something that's invisible there

Until we dead it, forget it, let it all disappear"
Linkin Park,Blackout,"I'm stuck in this bed you made,
Alone with a sinking feeling
I saw through the words you said
To the secrets you've been keeping
It's written upon your face, all the lies, how they cut so deeply
You can't get enough, you take and take and take and never say

No! You've gotta get it inside!
You push it back down, you push it back down!
No! You'll never get it inside!
Push it back down, blackout, blood in your eye!

You say that it's not your fault
And swear that I am mistaken
You said it's not what it seems, no remorse for the trust you're breaking
You run but then back you fall, suffocate in the mess you're making
You can't get enough you take and take and take and take and take
Fuck it, are you listening?

No! You've gotta get it inside!
You push it back down, you push it back down!
No! You'll never get it inside!
Push it back down, you push it back down!

No, you've gotta get it inside!
You push it back down, you push it back down!
No, you'll never get it inside!
Push it back down, blackout, blood in your eye!



Blackout / Blood in your eye
You push it back down / Push it back
You push it back down / Blood in your eye
Blackout / Blood in your eye
Blackout / Blood in your eye
Blackout / Blood in your eye
Blackout / Blood in your eye



Floating down as colours fill the light
We look up from the ground in fields of paper white
And floating up you pass us in the night
A future gazing out, a past to overwrite

So come down far below

Skylar Grey,I Will Return,"When you close your eyes
You could see the day rewind
All the laughs and stupid fights
You and I, we rode like thunder in the skies
And just like a party breaks at dawn
It never stops for long

I will return, don't you ever hang your head
I will return in every song that is unsaid
A memory is always within reach
I will return, I will return
Don't you ever hang your head

When you're feeling empty
I will be the fuel you need
To keep on pushing on
Down a lonely street
And I'm always in the shotgun seat
Home like headlights on the lawn
I'm never gone for long

I will return, don't you ever hang your head
I will return in every song that is unsaid
Our memory is always within reach
I will return, I will return
Don't you ever hang your head

I will return, don't you ever hang your head

I will return in every song that is unsaid
Our memory is always within reach

I know you fed up, you fall, get up
It's all in us, I can speak about 'cause I did it (true)
Ladies and gentlemen here's the exhibit
It's my life look a little closer you could see the highlight
Gold ain't always golden but I told 'em
Look at all the years I've been waiting for a moment
Shed a lot of tears just to smile in the morning
Tell me could you love me, tell me could you love me
Tell me could you love me if I told you why

Drifting off every second

I count the seconds

We'll torch this place we know
Before one of us takes a chance
And breaks this, I won't be the one
No, I won't be the one

I know it's pathetic
Fuck it, yeah, I said it
Tried to tell it like it is
There's a chance that I'll regret it, so
Let's go, let's end this
I delete before I send it
And we can play pretend
Like we haven't reached the end yet

Down and down we go
And we'll torch this place we know
Before one of us takes a chance

But they're just afraid of something they can't understand
Ooh, but, little darlin', watch me change their minds
Yeah, for you I'll try, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try
I'll pick up these broken pieces till I'm bleeding if that'll make you mine

One drag for my sorrow

You tell me baby, baby please don't go away (don't go away)
But when I play (when I play)
I never stay (I never stay)
To every girl that I meet here this is what I say

Run, run, runaway, runaway baby before I put my spell on you
You better get, get, getaway, getaway darling
'Cause everything you heard is true
Your poor little heart will end up alone
Cause Lord knows I'm a rolling stone
So you better run, run, runaway, runaway baby

Uh
Chicka ah

See I ain't try to hurt you baby
No, no, no I just wanna work you baby
Yup yup
See I ain't try to hurt you baby
No, no, no I just wanna work you baby
If you scared you better run
(You better run)
You better run
(You better run)
You better run
(You better run)
You better, you better, you better

Run, run, runaway, runaway baby before I put my spell on you
You better get, get, getaway, getaway darling
'Cause everything you heard is true
Your poor little heart will end up alone
Cause Lord knows I'm a rolling stone
So you better run, run, runaway, runaway baby"
Bruno Mars,Grenade,"Easy come, easy go, that's just how you live
Oh, take, take, take it all, but you never give
Should've known you was trouble from the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open, why were they open?

Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked
'Cause what you don't understand is

I'd catch a grenade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Oh, I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for you, baby
But you won't do the same

No, no, no, no

Black, black, black and blue, beat me till I'm numb
Tell the devil I said, hey, when you get back to where you're from
Mad woman, bad woman, that's just what you are
Yeah, you'll smile in my face then rip the brakes out my car

Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, yes you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked
'Cause what you don't understand is

I'd catch a grenade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Oh, I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for ya, baby
But you won't do the same

If my body was on fire
Ooh, you'd watch me burn down in flames
You said you loved me, you're a liar
'Cause you never, ever, ever did, baby

But darling, I'd still catch a grenade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Oh, I would go through all this pain

You wouldn't do the same
Ooh, you never do the same
No, no, no, no"
Bruno Mars,Moonshine,"Hello
You know, you look even better than the way you did the night before
And the moment that you kissed my lips, you know I started to feel wonderful
It's something incredible, there's sex in your chemicals, oh

Ooh, let's go

You're the best way I know to escape the extraordinary
This world ain't for you, and I know for damn sure this world ain't for me
Lift off and say goodbye
Just let your fire set me free, oh

Moonshine
Take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time

I know
I was with you last night but it feels like it's been so long
And everybody that's around they knows that I’m not myself when you're gone
It's good to see you again, good to see you again

On top of the world
Is where I stand when you're back in my life
Life's not so bad when you're way up this high
Everything is alright, everything is alright, oh

Moonshine
Take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time, ohh

Oh-ooh moonshine
Your love, it makes me come alive
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time

Don't look down, don't you never look back
We are not afraid to die young and live fast
Give me good times, give me love, give me laughs
Let's take a ride to the sky before the night is gone

Moonshine
Take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time, ohh

Oh moonshine
Your love, it makes me come alive
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time"
Bruno Mars,Gorilla,"Ooh, I got a body full of liquor with a cocaine kicker
And I'm feeling like I'm thirty feet tall
So lay it down, lay it down
You got your legs up in the sky with the devil in your eyes

Say it now, say it now

Look what you're doing, look what you done
But in this jungle you can't run

I promise it's a killer, you'll be banging on my chest
Bang bang, gorilla

Yeah, I got a fistful of your hair
But you don't look like you're scared
You're just smiling tell me, ""Daddy it's yours.""
'Cause you know how I like it you's a dirty little lover

If the neighbors call the cops, call the sheriff, call the SWAT
We don't stop, we keep rocking while they knocking on our door
And you're screaming ""Give it to me baby,
Give it to me motherfucker.""

Ooh, look what you're doing, look what you done

Bruno Mars,Young Girls,"I spent all my money
On a big old fancy car
For these bright eyed honeys

Keep me up till the sun is high
Till the birds start calling my name

Guess I've always been this way

All these roads steer me wrong

I get lost in the words I say

Boy meets girl, makes her his wife
But love don't exist when you live like this
That much I know, yes I know

Bruno Mars,Just The Way You Are,"Oh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her tryin'
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day

Yeah, I know, I know when I compliment her, she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, ""Do I look okay?""
I say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are

Yeah, her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh her laugh, she hates, but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day

Oh, you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for, then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change

Ed Sheeran,All Of The Stars,"It's just another night
And I'm staring at the moon
I saw a shooting star and thought of you
I sang a lullaby
By the waterside and knew
If you were here, I'd sing to you
You're on the other side
As the skyline splits in two
Miles away from seeing you
But I can see the stars
From America
I wonder, do you see them too?

So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will leave
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home

I can hear your heart
On the radio beat
They're playing ""Chasing Cars"" and I thought of us
Back to the time
You were lying next to me
I looked across and fell in love
So I took your hand
Back through lamp-lit streets and dew
Everything led back to you
So can you see the stars
Over Amsterdam?
Hear the song our heart is beating to

So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will leave
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home

And oh
And oh
And oh

I can see the stars
From America"
Ed Sheeran,Kiss Me,"Settle down with me
Cover me up
Cuddle me in
Lie down with me
Hold me in your arms

Your heart's against my chest
Lips pressed to my neck
I've fallen for your eyes
But they don't know me yet

And the feeling I forget
I'm in love now

Kiss me like you wanna be loved
Wanna be loved
Wanna be loved

This feels like I've fallen in love
Fallen in love
Fallen in love

Settle down with me
And I'll be your safety
You'll be my lady

I was made to keep your body warm
But I'm cold as, the wind blows
So hold me in your arms

My heart's against your chest
Your lips pressed to my neck
I've fallen for your eyes
But they don't know me yet

And the feeling I forget
I'm in love now

Kiss me like you wanna be loved
Wanna be loved
Wanna be loved

This feels like I've fallen in love
Fallen in love
Fallen in love

Yeah I've been feeling everything
From hate to love
From love to lust
From lust to truth
I guess that's how I know you

So hold you close
To help you give it up

So kiss me like you wanna be loved
Wanna be loved
Wanna be loved

This feels like I've fallen in love
Fallen in love
Fallen in love

So kiss me like you wanna be loved
Wanna be loved
Wanna be loved

This feels like I've fallen in love

Ed Sheeran,I See Fire,"Oh misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons

If this is to end in fire then we shall all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out father oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside

And if we should die tonight, we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out father oh, prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside
Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see fire
Inside the mountain, I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing soul
I see fire
Blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

Oh should my people fall then surely I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls, we got too close to the flame
Calling out father oh, hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside
Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see fire
Inside the mountain
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing soul
I see fire
Blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

And if the night is burning I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns then my brothers will die
And as this sky is falling down, it crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground I hear my people screaming out

And I see fire
Inside the mountains
I see fire
Burning the trees
I see fire
Hollowing souls
I see fire
Blood in the breeze

I see fire
Oh you know I saw a city burning (Fire)
And I see fire
Feel the heat upon my skin (Fire)
And I see fire
Oh (Fire)
And I see fire burn auburn on the mountainside"
Ed Sheeran,The A Team,"White lips, pale face, breathing in snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, day's end, struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men

And they say she's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream, been this way since 18
But lately her face seems slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries, they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

'Cause we're just under the upperhand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight

And in a pipe she flies to the motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside for angels to fly
Angels to fly

Ripped gloves, raincoat, tried to swim, stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes, weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone

And they say she's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream, been this way since 18
But lately her face seems slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries, they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

'Cause we're just under the upperhand
And go mad for a couple grams
But she don't want to go outside tonight

And in a pipe she flies to the motherland
Sells love to another man
It's too cold outside for angels to fly

An angel will die, covered in white
Closed eye and hoping for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line

And they say she's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream, been this way since 18
But lately her face seems slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries, they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

And we're all under the upper hand
Go mad for a couple grams
And we don't want to go outside tonight

In a pipe, fly to the motherland
Or sell love to another man
It's too cold outside for angels to fly
Angels to fly

To fly, fly
For angels to fly
To fly, to fly
Angels to die"
Ed Sheeran,Bloodstream,"I've been spinning now for time
Couple women by my side
I got sinning on my mind
Sipping on red wine
I've been sitting here for ages
Ripping out the pages
How'd I get so faded?
How'd I get so faded?

Oh
No no don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me how
You'd never learn
Ooh
Coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind

This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
Tell me when it kicks in

I've been looking for a lover
Thought I'd find her in a bottle
God, make me another one
I'll be feeling this tomorrow
Lord forgive me for the things I've done
I was never meant to hurt no one
I saw scars upon a broken-hearted lover

Oh
No no don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me how
You'd never learn
Ooh
Coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind

This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream

All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line

Ed Sheeran,Drunk,"I wanna be drunk when I wake up
On the right side of the wrong bed
And never an excuse that I made up
Tell you the truth I hate what
Didn't kill me, It never made me stronger at all

Love will scar your makeup
Lip sticks to me, so now I maybe lean back there
I'm sat here wishing I was sober
And no, I'll never hold you like I used to

But the house gets cold when you cut the heating
Without you to hold I'll be freezing
Can't rely on the heart to beating
'Cause you take part of it every evening
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing
Replace with phrases like 'when you leaving me?'

Should I?, Should I?
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love

I wanna hold your heart in both hands
Not watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can
And I got no plans for the weekend
So should we speak then? Keep it between friends
Though I know you'll never love me like you used to

There maybe other people like us
Who see the flicker of a clipper when they light up
Flames just create us but burns don't heal like before
And you don't hold me anymore

On cold days cold plays out like the band's name
I know I can't heal things with a handshake
You know I can change, as I began saying
You cut me wide open like landscape
Open bottles of beer but never champagne
To applaud you with the sound that my hands make

Should I?, Should I?
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love

All by myself, I'm here again
All by myself, you know I'll never change
All by myself
All by myself

I'm just drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love"
Ed Sheeran,Lego House,"I'm gonna pick up the pieces and build a Lego house
If things go wrong, we can knock it down
My three words have two meanings
But there's one thing on my mind, it's all for you

And it's dark in a cold December
But I've got ya to keep me warm
If you're broken, I will mend ya and I'll keep you
Sheltered from the storm that's raging on now

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now

I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now, now

I'm gonna paint you by numbers and color you in
If things go right, we can frame it and put you on a wall
And it's so hard to say it but I've been here before
Now I'll surrender up my heart and swap it for yours

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now

I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now

Don't hold me down
I think my braces are breaking
And it's more than I can take

And it's a dark and cold December
But I've got ya to keep me warm
If you're broken, I will mend ya and I'll keep you
Sheltered from the storm that's raging on now

I will love you better now"
Ed Sheeran,Don't,"I met this girl late last year
She said ""Don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her ""I'm not really looking for another mistake""
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away four months until our paths crossed again
She told me ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then should have just said, she's singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

For a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
But she was kissing him, how? I was confused about
She should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

*Knock knock knock* on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, but I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realized what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
All this time, God knows I'm singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe"
Ed Sheeran,Give Me Love,"Give me love like her
'Cause lately I've been waking up alone
Paint splattered teardrops on my shirt
Told you I'd let them go

And that I'll fight my corner
Maybe tonight I'll call ya
After my blood turns into alcohol
No, I just wanna hold ya

Give a little time to me or burn this out
We'll play hide and seek to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow
My, my-y, my, my-y, oh, give me love
My, my-y, my, my-y, oh, give me love
My, my-y, my, my-y, give me love

Give me love like never before
'Cause lately I've been craving more
And it's been a while but I still feel the same
Maybe I should let you go

And that tonight I'll call ya
After my blood is drowning in alcohol
No, I just wanna hold ya

Give a little time to me or burn this out

Ed Sheeran,I'm A Mess,"Ooh I'm a mess right now
Inside out
Searching for a sweet surrender
But this is not he end
I can't work it out
How?
Going through the motions
Going through us
And though I've known it for the longest time
And all my hope
All my words are all over written on the signs
But you're my road walking me home
Home, home

See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love
Easy baby maybe I'm a light
Before tonight I wanna fall in love
And put your faith in my stomach

A mess of this time
Late last night
Drinking to suppress devotion
With fingers intertwined
I can't shake this feeling now
We're going through the motions
Hoping it stops
And though I've only caused you pain
You know with all of my words
With all this beloved
Although all the lies spoke
When you're my road walking me home
Home, home, home

See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love
Easy baby maybe I'm a light
Before tonight I wanna fall in love
And put your faith in my stomach

And for how long I've loved my lover
For how long I've loved my lover
And now, for how long, long I've loved my lover
Now, now, for how long, long I've loved my lover
Now now, for how long, long I've loved my lover
(And I feel loved)
For how long, long I've loved my lover
For how long, long I've loved my lover
Feel it all over now
For how long, long I've loved my lover
Now, now, for how long, long I've loved my lover
Feel it all over now
For how long I've loved my lover
Now now
For how long, long I've loved my lover"
Ed Sheeran,Small Bump,"You're just a small bump unborn
In four months you're brought to life
You might be left with my hair
But you'll have your mother's eyes

I'll hold your body in my hands
Be as gentle as I can
But for now you're a scan of my unmade plans
A small bump, in four months you're brought to life

And I'll whisper quietly
And give you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you

You are my one and only, and you can wrap your fingers
'Round my thumb and hold me tight
You are my one and only, you can wrap your fingers
'Round my thumb and hold me tight, and you'll be alright

You're just a small bump unknown
You'll grow into your skin
With a smile like hers
And a dimple beneath your chin

Fingernails the size of a half grain of rice
And eyelids closed to be soon open wide
A small bump, in four months
You'll open your eyes

And I'll hold you tightly
And tell you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you

You are my one and only, and you can wrap your fingers
'Round my thumb and hold me tight, and you'll be alright

Then you can lie with me, with your tiny feet
When you're half asleep I'll leave you be
Right in front of me, for a couple weeks
So I could keep you safe

'Cause you are my one and only, and you can wrap your fingers
'Round my thumb and hold me tight
You are my one and only you can wrap your fingers
'Round my thumb and hold me tight, and you'll be alright

'Cause you were just a small bump unborn
For four months, then torn from life
Maybe you were needed up there
But we're still unaware as why"
Ed Sheeran,One,"Tell me that you turned down the man
Who asked for your hand
'Cause you're waiting for me
And I know, you're gonna be away a while
But I've got no plans at all to leave
And would you take away my hopes and dreams?
Just stay with me

All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
'Cause you are the only one

Take my hand and my
Heart and soul, I will
Only have these eyes for you
And you know, everything changes but
We'll be strangers if, we see this through
You could stay within these walls and bleed
But just stay with me

All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
'Cause you are the only one

I'm stumbling off drunk, getting myself lost
I am so gone, so tell me the way home
I listen to sad songs, singing about love
And where it goes wrong

All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
'Cause you are the only one"

Ed Sheeran,Sing,"It's late in the evening
Glass on the side
I've been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignoring everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
I don't wanna know
If you're getting ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no man's land
For the longest time lady

I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe

Sing
Louder
Sing

This love is ablaze
I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then we got nothing to say and nothing to know
But something to drink and maybe something to smoke
Let it go until our roads are changed
Singing ""We Found Love"" in a local rave, no
I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out and hope and pray
I told her my name and said ""it's nice to meet ya""
Then she handed me of a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know if she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness
I'm in deep if anybody finds out
I'm meant to drive home but I drunk all of it down
Not sober enough we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another now she's kissing my mouth

I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe

Sing
Louder
Sing

Can you feel it?
All the guys in here don't even wanna dance
Can you feel it?
All that I can hear is music from the back
Can you feel it?
Found you hiding here so I hoped you'd take my hand darling

Before the beats kicks in again
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe

Ed Sheeran,Don't,"I met this girl late last year
She said ""Don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her ""I'm not really looking for another mistake""
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away four months until our paths crossed again
She told me ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then should have just said, she's singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

For a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
But she was kissing him, how? I was confused about
She should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

*Knock knock knock* on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, but I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realized what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
All this time, God knows I'm singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe"
Ed Sheeran,Nina,"I met you when I was a teen
But then you were one as well
And I could play a guitar
Just like ringing a bell
Sometimes I wonder
In any other summer
Could you have been a part time lover to me
Listening to Stevie Wonder
Under the covers where we used to lay
And Re: Stacks is what the speakers played
I'd be on tour almost every day
When I was home up in my flat is where we used to stay

Just watching a DVD, smoking illegal weed
Getting high as two kites when we needed to breathe
We'd use each other's air just for the people to see
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep
We'd go anywhere our minds would take us
And I'll say you were beautiful without your make up
And you don't even need to worry about your weight cause
We can all be loved the way that God made us
And time's the only reason that we could break up
Cause you would always tell me I'm away too much
Distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane or make a mistake
So say it again

Oh Nina, you should go Nina
'Cause I ain't ever coming home Nina
Oh won't you leave me now
And I've been livin' on the road Nina
But then again you should know Nina
Cause that's you and me both Nina
Oh won't you leave me now, now

And every weekend in the winter you'd be wearing my hoodie
With drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold
Taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own
Cause every day when I was away we'd only speak on the phone
Watching blue planet, creating new habits
Acting as if we were two rabbits
And then you'd vanish
Back to the burrow with all the Celtics
I'd disappear, you'd call me selfish
I understand but I can't help it
I put my job over everything except my family and friends
But you'll be in between forever so I guess we'll have to take a step back
Overlook the situation cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications
And I'm not saying we should be taking a break
Just revaluate quick before we make a mistake and it's too late
So we can either deal with the pain and wait to get on a plane
But in a day we'll have to say it again

Oh Nina, you should go Nina
'Cause I ain't ever coming home Nina
Oh won't you leave me now
And I've been livin' on the road Nina
But then again you should know Nina
Cause that's you and me both Nina
Oh won't you leave me now, now

Love will come and love will go
But you can make it on your own
Sing that song
Go oh won't you leave me now
People grow and fall apart
But you can mend your broken heart
Take it back go oh won't you leave me now

x2:
Oh Nina, you should go Nina (Love will come and Love will go)
'Cause I ain't ever coming home Nina (But you can make it on your own)
Oh won't you leave me now (Sing that song, go oh won't you leave me now)
And I've been livin' on the road Nina (People grow and fall apart)
But then again you should know Nina (But you can mend your broken heart)
Cause that's you and me both Nina (Take it back, go oh won't you leave me now)
Oh won't you leave me now
Now"
Ed Sheeran,Photograph,"Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
Time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home

Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of you, mmm
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die

Mmm, we keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
Time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me
That's okay baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

Oh you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me
Well that's okay baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth Street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
Wait for me to come home"
Ed Sheeran,Bloodstream,"I've been spinning now for time
Couple women by my side
I got sinning on my mind
Sipping on red wine
I've been sitting here for ages
Ripping out the pages
How'd I get so faded?
How'd I get so faded?

Oh
No no don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me how
You'd never learn
Ooh
Coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind

This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
Tell me when it kicks in

I've been looking for a lover
Thought I'd find her in a bottle
God, make me another one
I'll be feeling this tomorrow
Lord forgive me for the things I've done
I was never meant to hurt no one
I saw scars upon a broken-hearted lover

Oh
No no don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me how
You'd never learn
Ooh
Coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind

This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
Tell me when it kicks in
Tell me when it kicks in

All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line...

Tell me when it kicks in
I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken-hearted
Tell me when it kicks in
I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken-hearted
Tell me when it kicks in
I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken-hearted
Tell me when it kicks in
I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken-hearted
Tell me when it kicks in
I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken-hearted
Tell me when it kicks in
I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in

Ed Sheeran,Tenerife Sea,"You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
The way it falls on the side of your neck
Down your shoulders and back

We are surrounded by all of these lies
And people who talk too much
You've got that kind of look in your eyes
As if no one knows anything but us

And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need

I'm so in love, so in love
So in love, so in love

You look so beautiful in this light
Your silhouette over me
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
Is the Tenerife Sea

And all of the voices surrounding us here
They just fade out when you take a breath
Just say the word and I will disappear
Into the wilderness

And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need

I'm so in love, so in love
So in love, so in love

Lumière, darling
Lumière over me
Lumière, darling
Lumière over me
Lumière, darling
Lumière over me
Lumière, darling
Lumière over me
Lumière, darling
Lumière over me
Lumière, darling
Lumière over me

And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need

I'm so in love, so in love
So in love, love, love, love,
So in love

You looked so wonderful in your dress
I loved your hair like that
And in the moment I knew you back"
Ed Sheeran,Runaway,"I've known it for a long time
Daddy wakes up to a drink at night
Disappearing all night
I don't wanna know where he's been lying
I know what I wanna do
I wanna run away
Run away with you
Gonna grab clothes, six in the morning, go

How long you leavin'?
Well dad just don't expect me back this evening
Oh it could take a bit of time to heal this
It's been a long day
Almost out of the wrong way
But I love him from the skin to my bones
But I don't wanna live in his home
There's nothing to say 'cause he knows
I'll just run away and be on my own

I've never seen my dad cry
Cold as stone, and the kitchen light
I'd tell you it's about time
But I was raised to keep quiet
And this is what I'm gonna do
Gonna run away, gonna make that move
Gonna grab clothes, and when it's morning, go

How long you leavin'?
Well dad just don't expect me back this evening
Oh it could take a bit of time to heal this
It's been a long day
Almost out of the wrong way
But I love him from the skin to my bones
But I don't wanna live in his home
There's nothing to say 'cause he knows
I'll just run away in the overnight

Back pack, and a flat cap, turned to the back
'Cause I packed my clothes up
My dad was a man without plans of attack and tends to show that
I don't wanna live this way
Gonna take my things and go
If things change in a matter of days
I could be persuaded to hold up
And mama was the same
None of us are saints
I guess that God knows that
I don't wanna run away
And one of these days I might just show that
Put my home in a suitcase
Tie both shoelaces and hope that
Things change, but for now I leave town with a backpack on my shoulder

But I love him from the skin to my bones
But I don't wanna live in his home
There's nothing to say 'cause he knows
I'll just run away and be on my own"
Ed Sheeran,The Man,"Now I don't wanna hate you
Just wish you'd never gone for the man
And waited two weeks at least
Before you let him take you
I stayed true
I kind of knew you liked the dude from private school
He's waiting for the time to move
I knew he had his eyes on you
He's not the right guy for you
Don't hate me 'cause I write the truth
No I would never lie to you
But it was never fine to lose you
And what a way to find out
It never came from my mouth
You never changed your mind
But you were just afraid to mind out
But fuck it, I won't be changing the subject I love it
I'll make your little secret public it's nothing
I'm just disgusted with the skeletons you sleep with in your closet to get back at me
Trapped and I'm lacking sleep
Fact is you're mad at me because I backtrack so casually
You're practically my family
If we married then I'll guess you'd have to be
But tragically our love just lost the will to live
But would I kill to give it one more shot
I think not

I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no
Anymore
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no
Anymore

Recently I tend to zone out
Up in my headphones to Holocene
You promised your body but I'm away so much
I stay more celibate than in a monastery
I'm not cut out for life on the road
'Cause I didn't know I'd miss you this much
And at the time we'd just go, so sue me
I guess I'm not the man that you need
Ever since you went to uni
I've been sofa surfing with a rucksack
Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad
But when I broke the industry
That's when I broke your heart
I was supposed to chart and celebrate
But good things are over fast
I know it's hard to deal with and see this
I tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features
Then I turn the music off
And all I'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces, Jesus
I never really want to believe this
Got advice from my dad and he
Told me that family is all I'll ever have and need
I guess I'm unaware of it
Success is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with

I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no
Anymore
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no
Anymore

And since you left, I've given up my days off
It's what I need to stay strong
I know you have a day job but mine is 24/7
I feel like writing a book, I guess I lied in the hook
'Cause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could
The irony is if my career and music didn't exist
In 6 years, yeah, you'd probably be my wife with a kid
I'm frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink
And lighting a spliff I fall into a spiral and it's
Just hiding my misguiding thoughts that I'm trying to kill
And I'd be writing my will before I'm 27, I'll die from a thrill
Go down in history as just a wasted talent
Can I face the challenge, or did I make a mistake erasing?
It's only therapy, my thoughts just get ahead of me
Eventually I'll be fine I know that it was never meant to be
Either way I guess I'm not prepared, but I'll say this
These things happen for a reason and you can't change shit
Take my apology, I'm sorry for the honesty
But I had to get this off my chest

I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no
Anymore
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no
Anymore"
Ed Sheeran,Thinking Out Loud,"When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?

And darling, I will be loving you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And I'm thinking 'bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Oh, me, I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

So honey, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same

'Cause honey, your soul
It could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
And I'm thinking 'bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Well, I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

But baby, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are

So baby, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh, maybe we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are"
Ed Sheeran,Afire Love,"Things were all good yesterday
And then the devil took your memory
And if you fell to your death today
I hope that heaven is your resting place
I heard the doctors put your chest in pain
But then that could have been the medicine
And now you're lying in the bed again
Either way I'll cry with the rest of them.

And my father told me, ""Son,
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face,
And you're not the only one.
Although my grandma used to say, he used to say...

Darling hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside for a little while he wrote
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light, in life, in love.
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together oh
With your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight, we're afire love, love, love oh.

Things were all good yesterday
And then the devil took your breath away
And now we're left here in the pain,
Black suit, black tie standing in the rain.
And now my family is one again,
Stapled together with the strangers and the friend.
Came to my mind I should paint it with a pen.
6 years old I remember when my father told me, ""Son,
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face,
And you're not the only one.
Although my grandma used to say, he used to say...

Darling hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside for a little while he wrote
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light, in life, in love.
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together oh
With your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight, we're afire love, love, love oh.'
See the love the love the love the love
See the love the love the love the love
See the love the love the love the love

And my father and all of my family rise from the seats to sing Hallelujah

And my brother and all my family rise from the seats to sing Hallelujah

(And all my brothers and my sisters yeah)

And my brother and all of my family rise from the seats to sing Hallelujah

See the love the love the love the love
See the love the love the love the love
See the love the love the love the love"
Ed Sheeran,Take It Back,"I'm not a rapper; I'm a singer with a flow
I've got a habit of spitting
Quicker lyrics you know
You found me ripping the writtens
Out of the pages they sit in
And never once I get bitten
Because plagiarism is hidden
Which I would sit on the rhythm
Prisoner with a vision
Signs of a label, but didn't listen to any criticism
Thought you knew but you didn't
So perk your ears up and listen
Studio is a system
And you could say that I'm driven
And now it's on to the next saga
We drink the best lager
I never tried to win you over
Like your stepfather
I do my own thing now, and get respect after
And I'm avoiding cocaine like it was Get Carter
For four years I never had a place to stay
But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight
At 16 years old, yeah I moved out of my home
I was Macy Gray I tried to say goodbye and I choked
To make from sleeping at the subway station
To sleeping with a Movie star and adding to the population
Not my imagination, I don't wanna relax
Would it hurt your reputation
If I put it on wax?
I'll take it back now...

Mmmm c'mon and take it back love,
C'mon and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love
No

Take it back with the rhythm and blues
With my rap pack I'll be singing the news,
Trying to act like Jack Black when I bring 'em to school
I'll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop,
Bringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes,
I give you the truth through the vocal booth,
Stars burst out on the scene like an opal fruit,
They try and take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot,
But then again that's what they're supposed to do,
And I'm supposed to be calm,
I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm,
Whispering everything that happens is from now on,
I'll be ready to start again at the end of the song,
Still their claiming that I handled it wrong,
But then I never had an enemy, except for NME,
But I'll be selling twice as many copies as the magazines will ever be,
With only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees,
I'm healthier than a Dalmatian on Pedigree,
Singing for the masses,
Rubber dinghy rapids,
Keep this rapping a habit
And keep on passioning magic,
I'm battling for respect,
I don't know if I'll have it,
This songs from the heart,
Cover the planet
I'll take it back now

Mmmm c'mon and take it back love,
C'mon and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love
No

Take it back now
Now I don't ever want to be perfect,
'Cause I'm a singer that you
Never want to see shirtless
And I accept the fact that someone has to win worst-dressed,
Taking my first steps into the scene,
Giving me focus
Putting on a brave face, like Timothy Dalton
Considering a name change,
Thinking it was hopeless
Rhyming over recordings
Avoiding tradition
Cause every day some lyrics
And a melody can be written
Now absence can make your heart break
But drinking absinthe can change your mind-state, vividly,
I need to let my liver be
And I say it again,
Living life on the edge,
With a closed hand full of friends
Is good advice from a man
Who took his life on the road with me
And I hope to see him blowing up globally
Cause that's how it's supposed to be
I'm screaming out vocally
It might seem totally impossible
Achieving life's dreams
But, but I just write schemes
I'm never having a stylist, giving me tight jeans
Madison Square Garden is where I might be
But more likely,
You'll find me in the back
Room of a dive bar with my mates
Having a pint with McDaid
Discussing records we made
And every single second knowing
That we'll never betray
The way we were raised
Remembering our background
Sat down
That's how we plan it out;
It's time to take it back now

Mmmm c'mon and take it back love,
C'mon and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love
No

Mmmm c'mon and take it back love,
C'mon and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love
No

My dreams keep me awake at night
Written in rhymes, till I deliver the hype
Am I just living the lie
With this you must know that the number's just sold whoa
Will keep me going through the tough times, dream with me
We forget 90 per cent of it when we wake
But the other 10 per cent it never fades
Dreaming dreams, day to day goals
Stay awake loads, try to make the cut like the
Paper or razor blade, oh, never give up
And just remember just to hold out more
A couple years ago
I couldn't just control that thought
You'd find me buskin' on the street
When it was cold outdoors
And now I'm sweating on the stage of a sold out tour
Writing love songs for the sake of it
Never to make a hit
You can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick
I'm not a rapper I'm a singer, I just take the piss and
Most of these other guys are kids that pose
His little sister has to babysit, that's just a way it is
Dreams you own, just set your goals
And have the utmost faith in it; tread your own path
You'll never make it as a follower, you'll never know
Where you will go or where you will be tomorrow"
Ed Sheeran,Shirtsleeves,"I can taste salt water
And if I blink again
You'll be sinking in
So we'll learn to swim in the ocean
You made to hold ya
And you think of him
And pretty soon you'll be floating away
And I'll hold on to the words you spoke of
Anchored down in my throat, love
And I'm captain of this sinking boat, now
We just want all men to carry me home
The saltedness won't dry
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
These hearts will be fully tonight
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes, you eyes

I still taste salt water
Oh my lips from your kiss bitterness
And I drown within the ocean you made
And I hate to love you, these cuffs cover in your make up
I'll never trust you again
You can just be a friend
And I'll hold on to the words you spoke of
Anchored down in my throat, love
And I'm captain of this sinking boat, now
We just want all men to carry me home
The saltedness won't dry
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
These hearts will be fully tonight
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
Your eyes, your lips, your mouth
Your thighs, your back, you drive me wild
Tonight, the fact design
I'm on my way home
On the way home
I lied, I tried to cry but I'm drowning in the ocean you made

The saltedness won't dry
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
These hearts will be fully tonight
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes, you eyes"
Ed Sheeran,Even My Dad Does Sometimes,"It's all right to cry
Even my dad does sometimes
So don't wipe your eyes
Tears remind you you're alive
It's all right to die
'Cause death's the only thing you haven't tried
But just for tonight hold on

So live life like you're giving all
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tell me your path

It's all right to shake
Even my hand does sometimes
So inside the rage
Against the dying of the light
It's all right to say that death's the only thing you haven't tried
But just for today hold on

So live life like you're giving all
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tell me your path

Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tell me your path
And hold on"
Ed Sheeran,I See Fire,"Oh misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons

If this is to end in fire then we shall all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out father oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside

And if we should die tonight, we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out father oh, prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside
Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see fire
Inside the mountain, I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing soul
I see fire
Blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

Oh should my people fall then surely I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls, we got too close to the flame
Calling out father oh, hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside
Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see fire
Inside the mountain
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing soul
I see fire
Blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

And if the night is burning I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns then my brothers will die
And as this sky is falling down, it crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground I hear my people screaming out

And I see fire
Inside the mountains
I see fire
Burning the trees
I see fire
Hollowing souls
I see fire
Blood in the breeze

I see fire
Oh you know I saw a city burning (Fire)
And I see fire
Feel the heat upon my skin (Fire)
And I see fire
Oh (Fire)
And I see fire burn auburn on the mountainside"
Ed Sheeran,Touch and Go,"Waking up, midnight November
And you're still in my bed
It's kinda rough, cause since I met ya
There's things we've never said

So if I go for a little while longer
When I'm home we can talk about the big falls of the road
If you say go, I would stop everything oh
My heart would play the role now
And act like it's never been broke

Though my soul
Oh, oh, oh lately I really need to know
How long, how long, can we be touch and go
Oh my soul, oh oh oh
How long, how long, can we be touch and go

It's not enough, to say I want ya
'Cause I'll say anything
I'm holding out, to feel without a doubt
I ha... have just been questioning yeah

If I go for a little while longer
When I'm home we can talk about the big falls of the road
If you say go, I would stop everything oh
My heart would play the role
And act like it's never been broke

Though my soul
Oh, oh, oh lately I really need to know
How long, how long, can we be touch and go
Oh my soul, oh oh oh
How long, how long, can we be

All of my bones, they scream I'm right
If you're taking me home to stay the night
Darling my soul would heal

If you say go, I would stop everything oh
My heart would play the role
And act like it's never been broke, though my soul
Lately I really need to know
How long, how long, can we be touch and go
Oh my soul, oh, oh, oh
How long, how long, can we be touch and go
How long, how long, can we be touch and go
How long, how long, can we be touch and go"
Ed Sheeran,New York,"Ooh Ooh whoa oh ohoh now now

Five drinks in on Friday night
We only came to dry your eyes
And get you out of your room

Now this bar has closed it's doors
I found my hand is holding yours
Do you wanna go home so soon?

Or maybe we should take a ride
Through the night
And sing along to every song
That's on the radio
In the back of a taxi cab in Brooklyn no no no
The sun could rise
Burning all the street lamps out at 3AM
So DJ, play it again

Until the night turns into morning
You'll be in my arms
And we'll keep driving
Along the boulevard
And if I kiss you, darling
Please don't be alarmed
It's just the start of everything if you want

A new love
In New York

In New York

Yesterday you gave me a call
Stressing out about it all
Said the world is moving too fast

And you don't know where to begin
'Cause you've spent a lifetime fitting in
Only to wind up on the other side
By yourself
And every day
Screaming out
To all the people that you used to know
From a window that looks upon the Manhattan skyline now
It's just the way that life goes
And you live it in every song you know
So DJ, play it again

Until the night turns into morning
You'll be in my arms
And we'll keep driving
Along the boulevard
And if I kiss you, darling
Please don't be alarmed
It's just the start of everything if you want

A new love
In New York

And every song that plays
Is just like the day you had
And it's okay to cry
But I'm saying that it's a waste of water
You know I'm here for you
In the back of the taxi cab tonight

In New York
It's just reached the morning
And you're still in my arms
Now we've stopped driving
Down the boulevard
And I just kissed you, darling
I hope you weren't alarmed
It's just the start of everything if you want

A new love
In New York

A new life
In New York"
Ed Sheeran,Make It Rain,"When the sins of my father
Weigh down in my soul
And the pain of my mother
Will not let me go
Well I know there can come fire from the sky
To purify pure as the canes
Even though
I know this fire brings me pain
Even so
And just the same

Make it rain
Make it rain down low
Just make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down low
Just make it rain
Make it rain

And the seed needs the water
Before it grows out of the ground
But it just keeps on getting hotter
And the hunger more profound
Well I know there can come tears from their eyes
But they may as well be in vain
Even though
I know these tears bring me pain
Even so
And just the same

Make it rain
Make it rain down low
Just make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down low
Just make it rain
Make it rain

Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain

Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain

And the seas are full of water
That stop by the shore
Just like the riches of grandeur
That never reach the port

So let the claps fill with thunderous applause
And let thy death be the veins
And fill the sky
With all that they can drop
When it's time
To make a change"

Lawson,Where My Love Goes,"My love goes out of my heart and into the wind
Out my guitar and under your skin
Into your house and out of your headphones
That's where my love goes

Wherever you go, I'll follow
Don't worry about tomorrow
I will be in your shadow
Walking right beside you everyday
I'll be the one to save ya
When I put my pen to paper
Feels like it brings us closer
Even when you're so far away

Bullet trains and aeroplanes
I can choose the easy way
So I'll send a signal just for you

My love goes out of my heart and into the wind
Out my guitar and under your skin
Into your house and out of your headphones

My love goes out of your door and into the street
Down through the floor and up through your feet
Into your car and out of your radio
That's where my love goes

You will never be lonely
Just relax and listen to me
I breathe the air that you breathe
I am always with you in disguise

Bullet trains and aeroplanes
I can choose the easy way

OneRepublic,Apologize,"I'm holding on your rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
And I'm hearing what you say
But I just can't make a sound

You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down, but wait
You tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around, and say

That it's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late

I'd take another chance
Take a fall, take a shot for you
And I need you like a heart needs a beat
But it's nothing new, yeah

I loved you with a fire red
Now it's turning blue, and you say
Sorry like the angel heaven let me think was you
But I'm afraid

It's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late

It's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late

Looks so good that it hurts

Troye Sivan,YOUTH,"What if
What if we run away
What if
What if we left today
What if
We said goodbye to safe and sound
And what if
What if we're hard to find
What if
What if we lost our minds
What if
We left them fall behind, and they're never found

And when the lights start flashing like a photobooth
And the stars exploding
We'll be fireproof

My youth
My youth is yours
Trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls
My youth
My youth is yours
Runaway now and forevermore

My youth is yours
A truth so loud you can't ignore
My youth, my youth, my youth
My youth is yours

What if
What if we start to drive
What if
What if we close our eyes
What if
Speeding through red lights into paradise
'Cause we've no time for getting old
Mortal body; timeless souls
Cross your fingers, here we go
Oh, oh, oh

And when the lights start flashing like a photobooth
And the stars exploding
We'll be fireproof

We can do anything we life
I know we both can get it right tonight
You got your walls built up high
I can tell by looking in your eyes

You don't understand how much you really mean to me
I need you in my life
You're my necessity
But believe me that you're everything
That just makes my world complete
And my love is clear the only thing I love

Taking my sulking to the masses

Take up my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the

Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh
Your spirit up above, oh-ooh

I was choking in the crowd
Living my brain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited

It rained down, like

By the grace of the fire and the flames

Well you're gone and I wish I'd done it better
Mostly I miss having you close to me
The only one who really ever knows me
And I'm sorry, I promise I'll do better, better

There's a hole in the middle of my heart again
Can we start again, can we start again
There's a hole in the middle and it never mends
It never mends, can we start again

Some nights, I kid myself I treated you right
Lying to myself, I didn't know
If I'm honest, I could've done it better
You said we had it pretty much perfect
And then you told me that you loved me
But you're sorry, you needed something better, better

There's a hole in the middle of my heart again
Can we start again, can we start again
There's a hole in the middle and it never mends
It never mends, can we start again

So I guess I'm gonna let you go
But you get to keep a little bit of my soul
So I guess I'm gonna write you out
But I don't think I can do it to me right now
Let's pretend that time heals all

There's a hole in the middle of my heart again
But I'm not afraid to start again
Start again, gonna start again

gnash,"i hate u, i love u (feat. olivia o'brien)","Feeling used
But I'm
Still missing you
And I can't
See the end of this
Just wanna feel your kiss
Against my lips
And now all this time
Is passing by
But I still can't seem to tell you why
It hurts me every time I see you
Realize how much I need you

I hate you I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

I miss you when I can't sleep
Or right after coffee
Or right when I can't eat
I miss you in my front seat
Still got sand in my sweaters
From nights we don't remember
Do you miss me like I miss you?
Fucked around and got attached to you
Friends can break your heart too, and
I'm always tired but never of you
If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that shit
I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that shit
I type a text but then I nevermind that shit
I got these feelings but you never mind that shit
Oh oh, keep it on the low
You're still in love with me but your friends don't know
If you wanted me you would just say so
And if I were you, I would never let me go
I don't mean no harm
I just miss you on my arm
Wedding bells were just alarms
Caution tape around my heart
You ever wonder what we could have been?
You said you wouldn't and you fucking did
Lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing
But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
When love and trust are gone
I guess this is moving on
Everyone I do right does me wrong
So every lonely night, I sing this song

I hate you I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

All alone I watch you watch her
Like she's the only girl you've ever seen
You don't care you never did
You don't give a damn about me
Yeah all alone I watch you watch her
She's the only thing you've ever seen
How is it you never notice
That you are slowly killing me

I hate you I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her"
James Arthur,Say You Won't Let Go,"I met you in the dark
You lit me up
You made me feel as though
I was enough
We danced the night away
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest

I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I know I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me
When I needed you most

I'm gonna love you till
My lungs give out
I promise till death we part
Like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you
Now everybody knows
That it's just you and me
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

Just say you won't let go
Oh, just say you won't let go"
Martin Jensen,Solo Dance,"In the faded light you touch my body
I can feel your hands on my skin
Think you got me right where you want me
But you're just in my way

I came to party on my own
Don't need nobody in my soul
I get on to the beat I lose control
Yeah oh I go solo

Boy you can cool it down
I need to fool around
Just wanna dance dance dance
Dance dance dance
I know you want me
But I don't care baby
Just wanna dance dance dance
Dance dance dance

Dance dance dance

In the shade of night you're moving closer
We're on our way to cross the line
Think you got me right where you want me
But it's all in your mind

I came to party on my own
Don't need nobody in my soul
I get on to the beat I lose control
Yeah oh I go solo

Boy you can cool it down
I need to fool around
Just wanna dance dance dance
Dance dance dance
I know you want me
But I don't care baby
Just wanna dance dance dance

Shakira,Chantaje,"Cuando estás bien te alejas de mí
Te sientes sola y siempre estoy ahí
Es una guerra de toma y dame
Pues dame de eso que tienes ahí

Oye baby no seas mala
No me dejes con las ganas
Se escucha en la calle
Que ya no me quieres
Ven y dímelo en la cara

Pregúntale a quien tú quieras
Vida, te juro que eso no es así
Yo nunca tuve una mala intención
Yo nunca quise burlarme de ti

Conmigo ves, nunca se sabe
Un día digo que no y otro que sí
Yo soy masoquista
Con mi cuerpo, un egoísta

Tú eres puro, puro chantaje
Puro, puro chantaje
Siempre es a tu manera
Yo te quiero aunque no quieras

Tú eres puro, puro chantaje
Puro, puro chantaje
Vas libre como el aire
No soy de ti ni de nadie

Como tú me tientas cuando tú te mueves
Ese movimiento sexy siempre me entretiene
Sabes manipularme bien con tus caderas
No sé porqué me tienes en lista de espera

Te dicen por ahí que voy haciendo y deshaciendo
Que salgo cada noche, que te tengo ahí sufriendo
Que en esta relación soy yo la que mando
No pares bola a toda esa mala propaganda

Pa-pa'qué te digo na', te comen el oído
No vaya a enderezar lo que no se ha torcido

Y como un loco sigo trás de tí
Muriendo por ti
Dime que hay pa'mi, bebé
Qué?

Pregúntale a quien tú quieras
Vida, te juro que eso no es así
Yo nunca tuve una mala intención
Yo nunca quise burlarme de ti

Conmigo ves, nunca se sabe
Un día digo que no y otro que sí
Yo soy masoquista
Con mi cuerpo un egoísta

Tú eres puro, puro chantaje
Puro, puro chantaje
Siempre es a tu manera
Yo te quiero aunque no quieras

Tú eres puro, puro chantaje
Puro, puro chantaje
Vas libre como el aire
No soy de ti ni de nadie
Nadie
Nadie
Nadie (nadie)

Con mi cuerpo un egoísta
Tú eres puro, puro chantaje

Siempre es a tu manera
Yo te quiero aunque no quieras

Anna Kendrick,True Colors,"You with the sad eyes
Don't be discouraged
Though I realize
It's hard to take courage
In a world full of people
You can lose sight of it all
The darkness inside you
Can make you feel so small

Show me a smile then,
Don't be unhappy, can't remember
When I last saw you laughing
This world makes you crazy
And you've taken all you can bear
Just call me up
'Cause I will always be there

And I see your true colors
Shining through
I see your true colors
And that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors
True colors are beautiful

I see your true colors
Shining through (True colors)
I see your true colors
And that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors
True colors are beautiful like a rainbow
Oh, whoa, like a rainbow

Oh, can't remember when I last saw you laughin'
Whoa, whoa, oh, oh, oh

This world makes you crazy
And you've taken all you can bear
Just call me up
'Cause I will always be there

And I see your true colors
Shining through
I see your true colors
And that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors
True colors are beautiful, whoa, like a rainbow
Oh, oh like a rainbow, oh, whoa"
James Arthur,Safe Inside,"I remember when you were all mine
Watched you change in front of my eyes
What can I say
Now that I'm not the fire in the cold
Now that I'm not the hand that you hold
As you're walking away

Will you call me to tell me you're alright
'Cause I worry about you the whole night
Don't repeat my mistakes
I won't sleep until you're safe inside
If you're home I just hope that you're sober
Is it time to let go now you're older
Don't leave me this way
I won't sleep until you're safe inside

Everyone has to find their own way
And I'm sure things will work out okay
I wish that was the truth
Oh, and always the sun will rise
Thank your lucky stars that you're alive
It's a beautiful life

Will you call me to tell me you're alright
'Cause I worry about you the whole night
Don't repeat my mistakes
I won't sleep until you're safe inside
If you're home I just hope that you're sober
Is it time to let go now you're older
Don't leave me this way
I won't sleep until you're safe inside

If you make the same mistakes
I'll love you either way
All I know is that I can't live without you
There is nothing I can say
That will change you anyway
Darling, I could never live without you
I can't live, I can't live

Will you call me to tell me you're alright
'Cause I worry about you the whole night
Don't make my mistakes
I won't sleep, I won't sleep
If you're home I just hope that you're sober
Is it time to let go now you're older
Don't leave me this way
I won't sleep until you're safe inside

Will you call me to tell me you're alright
'Cause I worry about you"
Ed Sheeran,Eraser,"I was born inside a small town, I lost that state of mind
Learned to sing inside the Lords House, but stopped at the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now, the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon that kept me on the grind
So blame it on the pain, that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive
And everyday that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride

You know that I've got whiskey with white lies and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind and clear myself up
Instead I look in the mirror questioning what I become
Guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me
Without a nine-to-five job or a uni degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
Show me the locked doors, I'll find another use for the key, and you'll see

I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me
But with that said, give me one more, higher
Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own so here I'll stay
Save your loving arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser

I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs
I changed the picture, perfect life, I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the root of all evil and fame is hell
Relationships and hearts you fix, they break as well
And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps
Because you're living your dream and that shit should be fun
Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run
I beg you don't be disappointed with the man I've become

Old conversations with my father on the A14
Aged twelve, telling me I've got to chase those dreams
Now I'm playing for the people Dad, and they know me
With my beat and small guitar wearing the same old jeans
Wembley Stadium crowds, two hundred and forty thou'
I may have grown up but I hope that Damien's proud
Until the next generation, inspiration's allowed
The world may be filled with hate but keep erasing it now, somehow

I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me
But with that said, give me one more, higher
Another one to take the sting away
Oh, I am happy on my own so here I'll stay
Save your loving arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser

Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
And where I'm heading, who knows?
But my heart will stay the same
Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
But where I'm heading, who knows?
My pain, eraser

And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser"
Ed Sheeran,Castle on the Hill,"When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
Tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass as I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I
Found my heart and broke it here, made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know, I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way, driving at ninety down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer, and I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Fifteen years old smoking hand rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when we found
Weekend jobs when we got paid we'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way, driving at ninety down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer, and I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
Ones already on his second wife
Ones just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

And I'm on my way, I still remember these old country lanes
When we did not know the answers, and I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill"
Ed Sheeran,Dive,"Oh, maybe I came on too strong
Maybe I waited too long
Maybe I played my cards wrong
Oh, just a little bit wrong
Baby I apologise for it

I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And jumping in harder than
Ten thousand rocks on the lake

So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
And don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you

You're a mystery
I have travelled the world
And there's no other girl like you, no one
No one, what's your history? (What's your history?)
Do you have a tendency to lead some people on?
'Cause I heard you do

I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And lie awake, every day
Don't know how much I can take

So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
And don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you

I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
Sitting back, looking at
Every mess that I made

So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
And don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you
Before I dive right into you
Before I dive right into you"
Ed Sheeran,Shape of You,"The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow

You come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put van the man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance
And now I'm singing like

Girl you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me

Say boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now follow my lead
Come, come on now follow my lead

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body

Last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
Well I'm in love with your body

(Oh I, oh I, oh I, oh I)
I'm in love with your body
(Oh I, oh I, oh I, oh I)
I'm in love with your body
(Oh I, oh I, oh I, oh I)
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate

We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play
And I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me

Say boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now follow my lead
Come, come on now follow my lead

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body

Last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
Well I'm in love with your body

(Oh I, oh I, oh I, oh I)
I'm in love with your body
(Oh I, oh I, oh I, oh I)
I'm in love with your body
(Oh I, oh I, oh I, oh I)
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

Come on be my baby, come on
Come on be my baby, come on
Come on be my baby, come on
Come on be my baby, come on

Come on be my baby, come on
Come on be my baby, come on
Come on be my baby, come on
Come on be my baby, come on

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body

Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new

Ed Sheeran,Perfect,"I found a love for me
Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight"
Ed Sheeran,Galway Girl,"She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""

I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl

You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing to Céilidh singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
Acapella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me

You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl

And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl"
Ed Sheeran,Happier,"Walking down 29th and park
I saw you in another's arm
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier
Saw you walk inside a bar
He said something to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do

Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're moving on with someone new

'Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
That I know I was happier with you
(Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah)

Sat on the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself
You're happier, aren't you?
(Hey yeah, hey yeah)

Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you (Hey yeah, hey yeah)
But ain't nobody need you like I do (hey yeah, hey yeah)
I know that there's others that deserve you (hey yeah, hey yeah)
But my darling, I am still in love with you

But I guess you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
I could try to smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
(Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah)
(Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah)
(Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah)
(Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah)

'Cause baby, you look happier, you do
I knew one day you'd fall for someone new
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
Just know that I'll be waiting here for you"
Ed Sheeran,New Man,"I heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans
Goes to the gym at least six times a week
Wears boat shoes with no socks on his feet
And I heard he's on a new diet and watches what he eats
He's got his eyebrows plucked and his arsehole bleached
Owns every single Ministry CD
Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means
But I heard he makes you happy so that's fine by me
But still, I'm just keeping it real, still looking at your Instagram and I'll be creeping a little
I'll be trying not to double tap, from way back, 'cause I know that's where the trouble's at
Let me remind you of the days when you used to hold my hand
And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans
I guess if you were Lois Lane, I wasn't superman, just a young boy trying to be loved
So let me give it to you

I don't wanna know about your new man, 'cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be calling me up trying to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man, we'll get there eventually
I know you're missing all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

Your new man rents a house in the burb, and wears a man bag on his shoulder but I call it a purse
Every year he goes to Malaga, with all the fellas, drinks beer but has a six pack, I'm kind of jealous
He wears sunglasses indoors in winter at nighttime, and every time a rap song comes on
He makes a gun sign, says chune, boydem light up the room
But enough about him, girl let's talk about you
You were the type of girl that sat beside the water reading
Eating a packet of crisps but you will never find you cheating
Now you're eating kale, hitting the gym, keeping up with Kylie and Kim
In the back of the club kissing a boy that ain't him
Ok you need to be alone, and if you wanna talk about it you can call my phone
I just thought that I would tell you cause you oughta know
You're still a young girl trying to be loved
So let me give it to you

I don't wanna know about your new man, 'cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be calling me up trying to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man, we'll get there eventually
I know you're missing all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

Baby, I'm not trying to ruin your week
But you act so differently
When you're with him I know you're lonely
Please, remember you're still free, to make the choice and leave
And don't call me up, you need to show me

I don't wanna know about your new man, 'cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be calling me up trying to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man, we'll get there eventually
I know you're missing all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

Positive that he don't wanna know about
Positive that he don't wanna know about
I don't wanna know about your new man"
Ed Sheeran,Hearts Don't Break Around Here,"She is the sweetest thing that I know
Should see the way she holds me when the lights go low
Shakes my soul like a pothole every time
Took my heart upon a one way trip
Guess she went wandering off with it
Unlike most women I know
This one will bring it back whole
Daisies, daisies perched upon your forehead
Oh my baby, lately I know

That every night I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear
""Oh, we're in love, aren't we?""
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah

She is the river flow in Orwell
And tin wind chimes used for doorbells
Fields and trees and her smell fill my lungs
Spend my summertime beside her
And the rest of the year, the same
She is the flint that sparks the lighter
And the fuel that will hold the flame, oh
Roses, roses laid upon your bed spread, oh my
All this, all this I know

But every night I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear
""Oh, we're in love, aren't we?""
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

Well, I've found loving inside
The arms of the woman I know
She is the lighthouse in the night
That will safely guide me home
And I'm not scared of passing over
Or the thought of growing old
'Cause from now until I go

Every night I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear
""Oh, we're in love, aren't we?""
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah, yeah

Every night I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear
""Oh, we're in love, aren't we?""
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah"
Ed Sheeran,What Do I Know?,"Ain't got a soapbox I can stand upon
But God gave me a stage, a guitar and a song
My daddy told me, ""Son, don't you get involved in
Politics, religions or other people's quarrels""

I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
I know when I have children they will know what it means
And I'll pass on these things my family's given to me
Just love, and understanding, positivity

We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but lord knows
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashing and their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote
Sing, love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment

The revolution's coming, it's a minute away
I saw people marching in the streets today
You know we are made up of love and hate
But both of them are balanced on a razor blade

I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
I know, I'm all for people following their dreams
Just re-remember life is more than fittin' in your jeans
It's love and understanding, positivity

We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but lord knows
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashing and their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song I wrote
Sing, love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment

I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
You know, the future's in the hands of you and me
So let's all get together, we can all be free
Spread love and understanding, positivity

We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but lord knows
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashing and their portfolios

Ed Sheeran,How Would You Feel (Paean),"You are the one, girl
And you know that it's true
I'm feeling younger
Every time that I'm alone with you

We were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we should not ask, but

How would you feel
If I told you I loved you
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too

In the summer
As the lilacs bloom
Blood flows deeper than a river
Every moment that I spend with you

We were sat upon our best friend's roof
I had both of my arms around you
Watching the sunrise replace the moon, but

How would you feel
If I told you I loved you
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too

Yeah, we were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we should not ask

How would you feel
If I told you I loved you
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
Tell me that you love me too
Tell me that you love me too
Tell me that you love me too"
Ed Sheeran,Supermarket Flowers,"I took the supermarket flowers from the window sill
I threw the day old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, ""Don't you cry when you're down""
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink

Oh, I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved

So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down, you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back he'll say, ""Hallelujah
You're home""

I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John said he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face

And I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived

So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back he'll say, ""Hallelujah
You're home""

Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
You got to see the person I have become
Spread your wings and I know
That when God took you back he said, ""Hallelujah
You're home"""
Ed Sheeran,Barcelona,"Well get up, up on the dance floor tonight
I've got two left feet and a bottle of red wine
Making me feel like the beat and the bass line
Are in my blood, both hands up on her waistline
Get on up, baby, dance to the rhythm of the music
Don't care what the DJ chooses
Get lost in the rhythm of me
Please don't close until we wanna leave it

And you and I, we're flying on an aeroplane tonight
We're going, somewhere where the sun is shining bright
Just close your eyes
And let's pretend we're dancing in the street
In Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona

Well, get up, up on the dancefloor, move, it's a Saturday night
I fell in love with the sparkle in the moonlight
Reflected in your beautiful eyes
I guess that is destiny doing it right
And dance like they do in the Mediterranean
Spin you around me again and again, and
You're like something that God has sent me
I want you, baby, solamente

And you and I, we're flying on an aeroplane tonight
We're going, somewhere where the sun is shining bright

Ed Sheeran,Bibia Be Ye Ye,"Bibia be ye ye

I lost my shoes last night, I don't know where I put my keys
I was tired and fell asleep beneath an oak tree
I bet my mother's proud of me from each scar
Upon my knuckle and each graze upon my knee, and all I know
Is I got a cab and then threw up upon his car seat
He kicked me out and then I walked in the rain
I tell myself in every way I won't be doing this again
And tomorrow's a brand new day

Someone told me, ""Always say what's on your mind""
And I am only being honest with you, I
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time
Se enioma enko ye, bibia be ye ye
Bibia be ye ye, ye ye, ye ye
Bibia be ye ye

I remember less and less and mostly things that I regret
In my phone are several texts, from girls I've never met
And in the pocket of my jeans are only coins and broken dreams
My heart is breaking at the seams and I'm coming apart now
Now things are looking up, I'll find my shoes right next to the oak tree
And I'll get a bus straight into town and spend the afternoon
Looking around for the things that I left on the ground
And say you're with me, tomorrow's a brand new day

Someone told me, ""Always say what's on your mind""
And I am only being honest with you, I
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time
Se enioma enko ye, bibia be ye ye

Ed Sheeran,Nancy Mulligan,"I was twenty-four years old
When I met the woman I would call my own
Twenty-two grand kids now growing old
In that house that your brother bought ya
On the summer day when I proposed
I made that wedding ring from dentist gold
And I asked her father, but her daddy said, ""No
You can't marry my daughter""

She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border

Well, I met her at Guy's in the second World War
And she was working on a soldier's ward
Never had I seen such beauty before
The moment that I saw her
Nancy was my yellow rose
And we got married wearing borrowed clothes
We got eight children, now growing old
Five sons and three daughters

She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border

From her snow white streak in her jet black hair
Over sixty years I've been loving her
Now we're sat by the fire in our old armchairs
You know Nancy, I adore ya
From a farm boy born near Belfast town
I never worried about the king and crown
'Cause I found my heart upon the southern ground
There's no difference, I assure ya

She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border"
Ed Sheeran,Save Myself,"I gave all my oxygen to people that could breathe
I gave away my money and now we don't even speak
I drove miles and miles, but would you do the same for me? Oh, honestly?
Offered off my shoulder just for you to cry upon
Gave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm
They gave me the heartache and in return I gave a song, it goes on and on

Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me, they just left me on the shelf, no farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself

I gave you all my energy and I took away your pain
'Cause human beings are destined to radiate or drain
What line do we stand upon, 'cause from here it looks the same
And only scars remain

Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me, they just left me on the shelf, no farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself

But if don't
Then I'll go back
To where I'm rescuing a stranger
Just because they needed saving just like that
Oh, I'm here again
Between the devil and the danger
But I guess it's just my nature
My dad was wrong
'Cause I'm not like my mum
'Cause she'd just smile and I'm complaining in a song
But it helps
So before I save someone else
I've got to save myself

Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me, they just left me on the shelf, no farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself
And before I blame someone else, I've got to save myself
And before I love someone else, I've got to love myself"

No limits just epiphanies

Tall Heights,Spirit Cold,"How do I wake my spirit cold?
We always say when our history's told
If only we knew the things we know
There's a question ages old

Let me down easy, let me down slow
If all good things ever come and go
Let me back down in a place I know
Hold the nail for the hammer stroke

Oh this my trash, this my tome
Oh this my blood, this my bone

How do I learn my dreams to mold,
To lay them bare in the morning cold?
If they're still out there then the chasm grows
For all you know, for all you've known

Let me down easy, let me down slow
If all good things ever come and go
Let me back down in a place I know
Hold that nail for the hammer stroke

Oh this my weapon, this my loam
Oh this my blood, this my bone

How do I wake my spirit cold?
Most people die but others just go
She's still out there and the chasm grows
Steady are the feet in the morning glow

Oh this my trash, this my tome
Oh this my weapon, this my loam
Oh this my mountain, this is my home

How do I wake my spirit cold?
There's a question ages old"
Amber Run,I Found,"I'll use you as a warning sign
That if you talk enough sense then you'll lose your mind
I'll use you as focal point
So I don't lose sight of what I want
I've moved further than I thought I could
But I miss you more than I thought I would
I'll use you as a warning sign
That if you talk enough sense then you'll lose your mind

I found love where it wasn't supposed to be
Right in front of me
Talk some sense to me

I'll use you as a makeshift gauge
Of how much to give and how much to take
I'll use you as a warning sign
That if you talk enough sense then you'll lose your mind

I found love where it wasn't supposed to be
Right in front of me
Talk some sense to me

I found love where it wasn't supposed to be
Right in front of me
Talk some sense to me"
John Mayer,I Will Be Found (Lost At Sea),"It doesn't matter where you roam
When no one's left to call you home
I might have strayed a bit too far
I'm countin' all the moon-lit stars

I'm a little lost at sea
I'm a little birdie in a big ol' tree
Ain't nobody looking for me
Here out on the highway

But I will be found
I will be found
When my time comes down
I will be found

Somedays I think it's all okay
Some nights I throw it all away
I saw a face and I could tell
My ghost had left her town as well

I'm a little lost at sea
I'm a little birdie in a big ol' tree
Ain't nobody looking for me
Here out on the highway

But I will be found
I will be found
When my time comes down
I will be found

I'm a little lost at sea
I'm a little birdie in a big ol' tree
Ain't nobody looking for me
Here out on the highway

Maybe I'm a runaway train
Maybe I'm a feather in a hurricane
Maybe it's a long play game, but maybe that's a good thing

'Cause I will be found
I will be found
When my time comes down
I will be found

So I keep running 'til my run is gone
Keep on riding 'til I see that dawn
And I will be found
I will be found"
Westlife,The Rose,"Shane:
Some say love, it is a river
That drowns the tender reed
Some say love, it is a razor
That leaves your soul to bleed

Some say love, it is a hunger
An endless aching need
I say love, it is a flower
And you, it's only seed

Mark:
It's the heart, afraid of breaking
That never learns to dance
It's the dream, afraid of waking
That never takes the chance

It's the one who won't be taken
Who cannot seem to give
Shane:
And the soul, afraid of dying
That never learns to live

All:
When the night has been too lonely
And the road has been too long

For the lucky and the strong

Far beneath the bitter snows

Becomes the rose"

Westlife,Have You Ever Been In Love,"Shane:
In the morning light
Half awake and half asleep
Have you ever laid there thinking
'Was it all a dream?'
But you reach out and she's there
Every moment, everywhere
Have you ever been in love?

Mark:
Have you ever felt
How far a heart can fall?
Have you ever stayed up waiting
For a telephone call
Just to hear them say 'hello'?
'Cause you miss each other so
Have you ever been in love?

Shane:
Have there been times to laugh
And times you really want to cry?
Finding reasons to believe her
'Cause you'd die a little if she lied

Mark:
And when in times of doubt
Have you ever tried to work it out?
But still she leaves you wondering
What it's all about

Shane:
And when she's far away
Have you ever felt the need to stray
And tried and then discovered
It just doesn't pay?
'Cause with her, you can be true
And with her, you can be you
Have you ever been in love?

Mark:
Have there been times to laugh
And times you really want to cry?
Finding reasons to believe her
'Cause you'd die a little if she lied

Shane:
And when in times of doubt
Have you ever tried to work it out?
But still she leaves you wondering
What it's all about

Mark:
And when the night comes down
Can you call your house a home?
Do you dream you're still together and wake up alone?

Shane:
Have you ever been in love the way that I'm in love?
Have you ever been in love?
Have you ever been in love?"
Westlife,Love Can Build A Bridge,"Shane:
I'd gladly walk across the desert
With no shoes upon my feet
To share with you the last bite of bread I had to eat
I would swim back to save you
In your sea of broken dreams
When all your hopes are sinking
Let me show you what love means

Love can build a bridge
Between your heart and mine
Love can build a bridge
Don't you think it's time?
Don't you think it's time?

Nicky:
I would whisper love so loudly
Every heart could understand
That love and only love
Can join the tribes of man

I would give my heart's desire
So that you might see
The first step is to realize
That it all begins with you and me

Shane:
Love can build a bridge
Between your heart and mine
Mark:
Love can build a bridge
Don't you think it's time?
Oh, don't you think it's time?

It's our finest hour
We can do anything, anything
Anything, anything

If we keep believing in the power!

Don't you think it's time?
Don't you think it's time?"
Westlife,The Dance,"Shane:
Looking back on the memory of
The dance we shared 'neath the stars above
And for a moment all the world was right
How could I have known that you'd ever say goodbye?

And now I'm glad I didn't know
The way it all would end, the way it all would go
Our lives are better left to chance
I could have missed the pain
But I'd have had to miss the dance

Mark:
Holding you, I held everything
For a moment wasn't I the king
But if I'd only known how the king would fall
Hey, who's to say? You know I might have changed it all

Shane:
And now I'm glad I didn't know
The way it all would end, the way it all would go
Our lives are better left to chance
I could have missed the pain
But I'd have had to miss the dance

Mark:
And now I'm glad I didn't know
The way it all would end, the way it all would go
Our lives are better left to chance

I could have missed the pain

Westlife,All Or Nothing,"Shane:
I know when he's been on your mind
That distant look is in your eyes

It's not the way I choose to live
But something somewhere's gotta give
As sharing this relationship gets older, older

Mark:
You know I'd fight for you but how can I fight someone who isn't even there?
I've had the rest of you now I want the best of you 
I don't care if that's not fair

Shane:
'Cause I want it all or nothing at all
There's nowhere left to fall
When you reach the bottom it's now or never
Is it all or are we just friends?
Is this how it ends with a simple telephone call?
You leave me here with nothing at all

Mark:
There are times it seems to me
I'm sharing you with memories
I feel it in my heart but I don't show it, show it
Then there's times you look at me
As though I'm all that you can see
Those times I don't believe it's right I know it, know it

Shane:
Don't make me promises baby 
You never did know how to keep them well
I've had the rest of you now I want the best of you 
It's time to show and tell

All:
'Cause I want it all or nothing at all
There's nowhere left to fall
When you reach the bottom it's now or never
Is it all or are we just friends?
Is this how it ends with a simple telephone call?
You leave me here with nothing

Mark:
'Cause you and I could lose it all if you've got no more room
No room inside for me in your life

Shane:
'Cause I want it all or nothing at all
There's nowhere left to fall
It's now or never

Is it all or nothing at all

Westlife,Flying Without Wings,"Shane:
Everybody's looking for a something
One thing that makes it all complete
You find it in the strangest places
Places you never knew it could be

Some find it in the face of their children
Some find it in their lover's eyes
Who can deny the joy it brings
When you've found that special thing
You're flying without wings

Mark:
Some find it sharing every morning
Some in their solitary lives
You'll find it in the words of others
A simple line can make you laugh or cry

You'll find it in the deepest friendship
The kind you cherish all your life
And when you know how much that means
You've found that special thing
You're flying without wings

So, impossible as they may seem
You've got to fight for every dream
'Cause who's to know which one you let go?
Would it made you complete?

Shane:
Well for me, it's waking up beside you
To watch the sunrise on your face
To know that I can say I love you
In any given time or place

Mark:
It's little things that only I know
All:
Those are the things that make you mine
Mark:
And it's like flying without wings
'Cause you're my special thing
I'm flying without wings

And you're the place my life begins
And you'll be where it ends
Mark:
I'm flying without wings
And that's the joy you bring
I'm flying without wings"
Mariah Carey,Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now),"How can I just let you walk away
Just let you leave without a trace
When I stand here taking every breath with you
You're the only one who really knew me at all

How can you just walk away from me
When all I can do is watch you leave
'Cause we shared the laughter and the pain
And even shared the tears
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now
'Cause there's just an empty space
There's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face

So take a look at me now
When there's just an empty space
And you're comin' back to me is against all odds
And that's what I've got to face

I wish I could just make you turn around
Turn around to see me cry
There's so much I need to say to you
So many reasons why

You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now
There's just an empty space
There's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face

So take a look at me now
'Cause there's just an empty space
But to wait for you is all I can do
And that's what I've got to face

Take a good look at me now
'Cause I'll be standing here
And you comin' back to me
Is against all odds
It's the chance I've gotta
Take
Hey yeah

Whoa
Take a look at me now

Westlife,Mandy,"Shane:
I remember all my life
Raining down as cold as ice,
Shadows of a man
A face through a window
Crying in the night
The night goes into

Morning, just another day
Happy people pass my way
Looking in their eyes
I see a memory
I never realized
How happy you made me oh Mandy

Well you came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away, oh Mandy
Well you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today, oh Mandy

Mark:
I'm standing on the edge of time
I've walked away when love was mine
Caught up in a world of uphill climbing
The tears are on my mind
And nothing is rhyming, oh Mandy

But I sent you away, oh Mandy
Well you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today, oh Mandy

Yesterday's a dream I face the morning
Crying on the breeze
The pain is calling, oh Mandy

When troubles come and my heart burdened be

A million people I
Still feel all alone
I just want to go home

And I've been keeping all the letters
That I wrote to you
Each one a line or two
""I'm fine baby how are you?""
Well I would send them but
I know it's that it's just not enough
My words were cold and flat
And you deserve more, than that

Another aeroplane
Another sunny place

Westlife,What About Now,"Shane:
Shadows fill an empty heart
As love is fading,
From all the things that we are
But are not saying
Can we see beyond the stars,
And make it to the dawn?

Change the colours of the sky
And open up to the ways you made me feel alive,
The ways I loved you
For all the things that never died,
To make it through the night,
Love will find you

All:
What about now?
What about today?
What if you're making me all that I was meant to be?
What if our love never went away?
What if it's lost behind words we could never find?

What about now?

To start a new day
This broken heart can still survive
With a touch of your grace
Shadows fade into the light

Where love will find you

Westlife,Beautiful World,"Shane:
Here we go, lost in the lessons
Sometimes I mess up my intentions
I get lost, the cost was losing everything I've known
Laying here, staring at the ceiling
Sometimes still dealing with the feelings
Where I've been, what I've done
I'm so far out there on my own
So quick to point the finger to find the one to blame
So hard to realize, I kept getting in my own way

I never thought that I was that strong
To carry on, carry on tonight
Forgiveness in your eyes, with nothing to hide
All I know is you've shown me
It's a beautiful world
It's a beautiful world

Mark:
No more fearing my reflection
Here I am, with these imperfections
You know my flaws, but you don't care, you can take them all
Till now I was barely breathing
But you gave me something to believe in
We're writing history
Life's made up of small victories
We could go round in circles and never get to here
So good to realize that we have nothing left to fear

I never thought that I was that strong
To carry on, carry on tonight

This world could be ours

So I'm letting go tonight
And handing you the knife

If you cut me wide open
There's love here unspoken
A heart overflowing
Dreaming of your kiss
I'm standing here hoping,
For the moment you say when
Touching your skin, kissing
You kill me every time
I would die for you

I could go on and pretend
And play the fool again
How can I just walk away,
From everything I feel?

There's love here unspoken
A heart overflowing
Dreaming of your kiss

The moon, the stars, are nothing without you
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain, the way I'm missing you
The night, this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
These tears, they tell their own story

You told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
And I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

I'm reaching out to you
Can you hear my call?
This hurt that I've been through
I'm missing you, missing you like crazy, daily

Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
And I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
And make sure you're alright"

But I'm a have a good time ballin' or out
Tell the bartender line up some shots
'Cause I'm a get loose tonight
She's on fire, she's so hot
I'm no liar, she burned the spot
Look like Mariah, I took another shot
Told her drop, drop, drop, drop it like it's hot
Dirty talk, dirty dance
She a freaky girl and I'm a freaky man
She on the rebound, broke up with her ex
And I'm like Rodman, ready on deck
I told her I wanna ride out, and she said yes
We didn't go to church, but I got blessed

Tonight I'm a lose my mind
Better get yours 'cause I'm gonna get mine
Party every night like my last
Mommy know the drill, shake that ass
Go ahead baby let me see what you got
You know you got the biggest booty in this spot
And I just wanna see that thing drop
From the back to the front to the top
You know me I'm off in the cut
Always like a squirrel, looking for a nut
This isn't for show I'm not talking 'bout luck
I'm not talking 'bout love, I'm talking 'bout lust
Now let's get loose, have some fun
Forget about bills and the first of the month
It's my night, your night, our night, let's turn it up

Enrique Iglesias,Hero,"Let me be your hero. (Whisper) 

Would you dance
if I asked you to dance?
Would you run
And never look back?
Would you cry
If you saw me cryin'?
And would you save my soul tonight?

Would you tremble
If I touched your lips?
Would you laugh?
Oh please tell me this.
Now, would you die
For the one you love?
Hold me in your arms tonight.

I can be your hero, baby.
I can kiss away the pain.
I will stand by you forever.
You can take my breath away.

Would you swear
That you'll always be mine?
Would you lie?
Would you run and hide?
Am I in too deep?
Have I lost my mind?
I don't care, you're here tonight.

I can be your hero, baby.
I can kiss away the pain.
I will stand by you forever.
You can take my breath away.

Oh, I just wanna hold you.
I just wanna hold you, oh yeah.

Am I in too deep?
Have I lost my mind?
Well, I don't care, you're here tonight.

I can be your hero, baby.
I can kiss away the pain, oh yeah.
I will stand by you forever.
You can take my breath away.

I can be your hero, baby.
I can kiss away the pain.
I will stand by you forever.
You can take my breath away.

You can take my breath away.

I can be your hero."
Ed Sheeran,How Would You Feel (Paean),"You are the one, girl
And you know that it's true
I'm feeling younger
Every time that I'm alone with you

We were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we should not ask, but

How would you feel
If I told you I loved you
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too

In the summer
As the lilacs bloom
Blood flows deeper than a river
Every moment that I spend with you

We were sat upon our best friend's roof
I had both of my arms around you
Watching the sunrise replace the moon, but

How would you feel
If I told you I loved you
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too

Yeah, we were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we should not ask

How would you feel
If I told you I loved you
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
Tell me that you love me too
Tell me that you love me too
Tell me that you love me too"
Maroon 5,Cold,"Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold

Are we taking time or a time out?
I can't take the in-between
Asking me for space here in my house
You know how to fuck with me
Acting like we're not together
After everything that we've been through
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you?

Distant, when we're kissing
Feel so different
Baby tell me how did you get so

Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah
I don't understand why you're so cold

What you holdin' on, holdin' on for?
If you wanna leave just leave
Why you wanna bite your tongue for?
The silence is killing me
Acting like we're not together
If you don't want this, then what's the use?
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you?

Distant, when we're kissing
Feel so different
Baby tell me how did you get so

Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah

I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah
So fuck this cold world
So fuck this cold world
So fuck this cold world
I don't understand why you're so cold

Never thought that you were like this
I took the tag off and made you priceless
I just spent half a mill' on a chandelier
Now you tryna cut me off like a light switch, yeah
Tryna stay, and I leave
Saying that you need some time to breath
Thinking that I'm sleeping on the four letter word
But the four letter word don't sleep
We goin' two separate ways
You ain't been actin' the same
You gotta go, but where your heart used to be
You gold dig every day
I switched the four door to the two door
'Cause I can't let my driver hear what you say
Girl I tried to give you space
Baby tell me how did you get so

Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold

So fuck this cold world
So fuck this cold world
So fuck this cold world
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah
So fuck this cold world
So fuck this cold world
So fuck this cold world
I don't understand why you're so cold"
Ed Sheeran,Thinking Out Loud,"When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?

And darling, I will be loving you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And I'm thinking 'bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Oh, me, I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

So honey, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same

'Cause honey, your soul
It could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
And I'm thinking 'bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Well, I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

But baby, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are

So baby, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh, maybe we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are"

'Cause you're my baby, rejoice daily
I believe love could bring us closer than blood

I remember having four stepmoms at nine
Loved Christmas time and birthday was fly
Ate at my sisters just for dinner cause the cookin' was bomb
Her mother's supper made me love her like she took me to prom, uh
And shoutout to my sisters on welfare
Flacko care, nobody else care
And shoutout to the stepsisters and stepbrothers
And godsisters, who eventually slept with us

Real love, but you do it right, all right
I'm here for you
And it seems all right, all right

That's what you do, what you do
What you do, what you do for love (that's just what yo do)
There ain't nothing, there ain't nothing
There ain't nothing I won't do for us (for you baby)
It may not be easy
This blended family but baby
That's what you do, what you do
What you do, what you do for love, love

That's just what you do, yeah (for love)
For the love of the babies (for love)
We're a blended family (for love)
And it's all right (for love)
Said it's all right
I'll be here forever"

All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse

Welcome to the room of people
Who have rooms of people that they loved one day
Docked away
Just because we check the guns at the door
Doesn't mean our brains will change
From hand grenades

You'll never know the psychopath sitting next to you
You'll never know the murderer sitting next to you
You'll think, how'd I get here sitting next to you?
But after all I've said, please don't forget

All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse

We don't deal with outsiders very well
They say newcomers have a certain smell
You have trust issues, not to mention
They say they can smell your intentions

You'll never know the freakshow sitting next to you
You'll have some weird people sitting next to you
You'll think ""How did I get here, sitting next to you""
But after all I've said, please don't forget

Maren Morris,My Church,"I’ve cussed on a Sunday
I’ve cheated and I’ve lied
I’ve fallen down from grace
A few too many times
But I find holy redemption
When I put this car in drive
Roll the windows down and turn up the dial

Can I get a 'hallelujah'?
Can I get an 'amen'?
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
When I play the highway FM
I find my soul revival
Singin' every single verse
Yeah, I guess that’s my church

When Hank brings the sermon
And Cash leads the choir
It gets my cold, cold heart burning
Hotter than a ring of fire
When this wonderful world gets heavy
And I need to find my escape
I just keep the wheels rollin', radio scrollin'
Until my sins wash away

Can I get a 'hallelujah'?
Can I get an 'amen'?
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
When I play the highway FM
I find my soul revival
Singin' every single verse
Yeah, I guess that’s my church

Can I get a 'hallelujah'?

Seems like they're just happier than us these days
Yeah, these days I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to be there when you need me
It feels like the only time you see me
Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently

It can't end like this
We gotta take time with this
Cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it
Let me see if this is something I can fix
You got somebody other than me
Don't play the victim when you're with me
Free time is costing me more than it seems
Sacrificing things
And I wanna tell you my intentions
I wanna do the things that I mention
I wanna benefit from the friendship
I wanna get the late night message from you, from you
I put my hands around you
Gotta get a handle on you
Gotta get a handle on the fact that...

Thomas Rhett,Die A Happy Man,"Baby, last night was hands down
One of the best nights
That I've had, no doubt
Between the bottle of wine
And the look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye
Then we danced in the dark under September stars in the pourin' rain

And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love
If I never get to see the Northern lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man
A happy man, baby

Baby, that red dress brings me to my knees
Oh, but that black dress makes it hard to breathe
You're a saint; you're a goddess; the cutest; the hottest; a masterpiece
It's too good to be true, nothing better than you
In my wildest dreams

And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love
If I never get to see the Northern lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man, yeah

I don't need no vacation, no fancy destination
Baby, you're my great escape
We could stay at home, listen to the radio
Or dance around the fireplace

Well, if I never get to build my mansion in Georgia
Or drive a sports car up the coast of California
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man

Baby, I could die a happy man
Baby, I could die a happy man
Oh, I could die a happy man
You know I could, girl
I could die, I could die a happy man"
Twenty One Pilots,Stressed Out,"I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang

I was told when I get older all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure and I care what people think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time to the good ol' days
When our mama sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
Wish we could turn back time to the good ol' days
When our mama sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
We're stressed out

Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from?
I'd make a candle out of it if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one

It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, home-grown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and tree-house homes, we all would take the latter

My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol' days
When our mama sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol' days
When our mama sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out

We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face
Saying, ""Wake up, you need to make money"", yeah

We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face
Saying, ""Wake up, you need to make money"", yeah

Wish we could turn back time to the good ol' days
When our mama sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
Wish we could turn back time to the good ol' days
When our mama sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out

We used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money

Used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away

Mike Posner,I Took A Pill In Ibiza,"I took a pill in Ibiza
To show Avicii I was cool
And when I finally got sober, felt 10 years older
But fuck it, it was something to do
I'm living out in LA
I drive a sports car just to prove
I'm a real big baller 'cause I made a million dollars
And I spend it on girls and shoes

But you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs

I'm just a singer who already blew his shot
I get along with old timers
'Cause my name's a reminder of a pop song people forgot
And I can't keep a girl, no
'Cause as soon as the sun comes up
I cut 'em all loose and work's my excuse
But the truth is I can't open up

But you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs

I took a plane to my home town
I brought my pride and my guitar
All my friends are all gone but there's manicured lawns
And the people still think I'm a star
I walked around downtown
I met some fans on Lafayette
They said ""tell us how to make it 'cause we're getting real impatient""
So I looked 'em in the eye and said

You don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All that I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all that I know are sad songs, sad songs"

Lauv,The Other,"Like a spotlight the water hits me
Ran it extra cold to shake the words from my mouth
Though I know that no one's listening
I nervously rehearsed for when you're around
And I keep waiting like you might change my mind

Who wrote the book on goodbye?
There's never been a way to make this easy
When there's nothing quite wrong but it don't feel right
Either your head or your heart, you set the other on fire

Back and forth now I'm feelin' guilty
'Cause I just can't stop this pendulum in my head
Though I know that our time is ending
I'd rather lay forever right in this bed

And I keep waiting like, you might change my mind
Give me one more night

Who wrote the book on goodbye?
There's never been a way to make this easy
When there's nothing quite wrong but it don't feel right
Either your head or your heart, you set the other on fire

No one knows, knows, knows. No one knows, knows, knows

We fell from the peak
And the stars, they broke their code
I'm trying to forget
How I landed on this road
I'm caught in between
What I wish and what I know
When they say that you just know

Who wrote the book on goodbye?
There's never been a way to make this easy
When there's nothing quite wrong but it don't feel right
Either your head or your heart, you set the other on fire

No one knows, knows, knows. No one knows, knows, knows

You set the other on fire. You set the other on fire"

fun.,We Are Young (feat. Janelle Monáe),"Give me a second I, I need to get my story straight
My friends are in the bathroom getting higher than the Empire State
My lover, she is waiting for me just across the bar
My seat's been taken by some sunglasses asking 'bout a scar

And I know I gave it to you months ago
I know you're trying to forget
But between the drinks and subtle things
The holes in my apologies, you know
I'm tryin' hard to take it back

So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I'll carry you home

Tonight, we are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun
Tonight, we are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

Now, I know that I'm not all that you got
I guess that I, I just thought
Maybe we could find new ways to fall apart
But our friends are back
So let's raise a toast
'Cause I found someone to carry me home

Tonight, we are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun
Tonight, we are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

Carry me home tonight (na na na na na na)
Just carry me home tonight (na na na na na na)
Carry me home tonight (na na na na na na)
Just carry me home tonight (na na na na na na)

The moon is on my side
I have no reason to run
So will someone come and carry me home tonight?
The angels never arrived
But I can hear the choir
So will someone come and carry me home?

Tonight, we are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun
Tonight, we are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

Imagine Dragons,Demons,"When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all and the blood's run stale

I want to hide the truth, I want to shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

At the curtain's call, it's the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made

Don't want to let you down but I am hellbound
Though this is all for you, don't want to hide the truth
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

They say it's what you make, I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul, I need to let you go
Your eyes, they shine so bright, I want to save that light
I can't escape this now unless you show me how

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide"
A Great Big World,Say Something,"Say something, I'm giving up on you
I'll be the one, if you want me to
Anywhere, I would've followed you
Say something, I'm giving up on you

And I am feeling so small
It was over my head
I know nothing at all

And I will stumble and fall
I'm still learning to love
Just starting to crawl

Say something, I'm giving up on you
I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you
Anywhere, I would've followed you
Say something, I'm giving up on you

And I will swallow my pride
You're the one that I love
And I'm saying goodbye

Say something, I'm giving up on you
And I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you
And anywhere, I would have followed you, oh
Say something, I'm giving up on you

Say something, I'm giving up on you
Say something"
Lorde,Team,"Wait till you're announced
We've not yet lost all our graces
The hounds will stay in chains
Look upon your greatness
And she'll send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out

Call all the ladies out
They're in their finery
A hundred jewels on throats
A hundred jewels between teeth

Now bring my boys in
Their skin in craters like the moon
The moon we love like a brother
While he glows through the room

Dancin' around the lies we tell
Dancin' around big eyes as well, ah
Even the comatose
They don't dance and tell

We live in cities you'll never see on screen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Living in ruins of the palace within my dreams
And you know, we're on each other's team

I'm kind of over getting told
To throw my hands up in the air
So there

So all the cups got broke
Shards beneath our feet
But it wasn't my fault

And everyone's competing
For a love they won't receive
'Cause what this palace wants is release

We live in cities you'll never see on screen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Living in ruins of the palace within my dreams
And you know, we're on each other's team

I'm kind of over getting told
To throw my hands up in the air
So there

I'm kinda older than I was
When I revelled without a care
So there

We live in cities you'll never see on screen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Living in ruins of the palace within my dreams
And you know, we're on each other's team

We're on each other's team
And you know, we're on each other's team
We're on each other's team
And you know, and you know, and you know"
Sia,Chandelier,"Party girls don't get hurt
Can't feel anything, when will I learn?

I feel the love, feel the love

One, two, three; one, two, three; drink
One, two, three; one, two, three; drink
One, two, three; one, two, three; drink
Throw 'em back till I lose count

I'm gonna swing from the chandelier, from the chandelier
I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist, like it doesn't exist
I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night, feel my tears as they dry
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier, from the chandelier

But I'm holding on for dear life
Won't look down, won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight

Help me, I'm holding on for dear life
Won't look down, won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light

Gotta get out now, gotta run from this
Here comes the shame, here comes the shame (oh)

Kelly Clarkson,Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You),"You know the bed feels warmer
Sleepin' here alone
You know I dream in color
And do the things I want

You think you got the best of me
Think you've had the last laugh
Bet you think that everything good is gone
Think you left me broken down
Think that I'd come running back
Baby you don't know me, 'cause you're dead wrong

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over 'cause you're gone

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

You heard that I was starting over
With someone new
They told you I was moving on
Over you

You didn't think that I'd come back
I'd come back swingin'
You try to break me
But you see

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over 'cause you're gone

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

Thanks to you, I got a new thing started
Thanks to you, I'm not the brokenhearted
Thanks to you, I'm finally thinkin' 'bout me
You know in the end the day you left was just my beginning
In the end

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over 'cause you're gone

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
When I'm alone"

Rihanna,We Found Love,"Yellow diamonds in the light
Now we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive

It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Shine a light through an open door
Love and life I will divide
Turn away 'cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind

It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Descemer

Yo te miro y se me corta la respiración
Cuando tú me miras se me sube el corazón
(Me palpita lento el corazón)
Y en un silencio tu mirada dice mil palabras
La noche en la que te suplico que no salga el sol

Bailando (bailando), bailando (bailando)
Tu cuerpo y el mío llenando el vacío
Subiendo y bajando (subiendo y bajando)
Bailando (bailando), bailando (bailando)
Ese fuego por dentro me está enloqueciendo
Me va saturando

Con tu física y tu química
También tu anatomía
La cerveza y la tequila
Y tu boca con la mía
Y ya no puedo más
(Y ya no puedo más)
Y ya no puedo más
(Y ya no puedo más)

Con esta melodía
Tu color tu fantasía
Con tu filosofía
Mi cabeza esta vacía
Y ya no puedo más

Vivir contigo
Bailar contigo
Tener contigo
Una noche loca (una noche loca)
Ay besar tu boca (y besar tu boca)

Yo quiero estar contigo
Vivir contigo
Bailar contigo
Tener contigo
Una noche loca
Con tremenda nota

Tu me miras y me llevas a otra dimensión (estoy en otra dimensión)
Tus latidos aceleran a mi corazón (Tus latidos aceleran a mi corazón)
Que ironía del destino no poder tocarte
Abrazarte, y sentir la magia de tu olor

Bailando (bailando), bailando (bailando)
Tu cuerpo y el mío llenando el vacío
Subiendo y bajando (subiendo y bajando)
Bailando (bailando), bailando (bailando)

Justin Timberlake,Mirrors,"Aren't you somethin' to admire
Cause your shine is somethin' like a mirror
And I can't help but notice
You reflect in this heart of mine
If you ever feel alone and
The glare makes me hard to find
Just know that I'm always
Parallel on the other side

Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass
I'm here tryin' to pull you through
You just gotta be strong

Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me
I couldn't get any bigger
With anyone else beside me
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making
Two reflections into one
Cause it's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me

Aren't you somethin', an original
Cause it doesn't seem really as sample
And I can't help but stare, cause
I see truth somewhere in your eyes
I can't ever change without you
You reflect me, I love that about you
And if I could, I
Would look at us all the time

Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass
I'm here tryin' to pull you through
You just gotta be strong

Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold

And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making
Two reflections into one
Cause it's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me

Yesterday is history
Tomorrow's a mystery
I can see you lookin' back at me
Keep your eyes on me
Baby, keep your eyes on me

Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy

My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me

You are, you are the love of my life

Baby, you're the inspiration of this precious song
And I just wanna see your face light up since you put me on
So now I say goodbye to the old me, it's already gone
And I can't wait wait wait wait wait to get you home
Just to let you know, you are

Girl you're my reflection, all I see is you
My reflection, in everything I do
You're my reflection and all I see is you
My reflection, in everything I do

You are, you are the love of my life"

Lorde,Royals,"I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address
In the torn-up town, no postcode envy

But every song's like
Gold teeth, Grey Goose, tripping in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashing the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams

But everybody's like
Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair

And we'll never be royals (Royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz

Let me be your ruler (Ruler)
You can call me Queen Bee
And baby, I'll rule (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy

My friends and I, we've cracked the code
We count our dollars on the train to the party
And everyone who knows us knows
That we're fine with this, we didn't come from money

But every song's like
Gold teeth, Grey Goose, tripping in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashing the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams

But everybody's like
Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair

And we'll never be royals (Royals)

That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz

Let me be your ruler (Ruler)
You can call me Queen Bee
And baby, I'll rule (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy

Oh, oh, oh
We're bigger than we ever dreamed
And I'm in love with being queen

Oh, oh, oh
Life is great without a care
We aren't caught up in your love affair

And we'll never be royals (Royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz

Let me be your ruler (Ruler)
You can call me Queen Bee

Would you lay down in my arms and rescue me?

You saved me, but when you leave it's gone again

In his arms, I get weak
My body fails, I'm on my knees

When he opens his arms
And holds you close tonight

When he lays you down, I might just die inside

For a little while inside my arms, yeah

To the way that you kiss on me
It's everything about you, you, you
The way you make it feel, new, new, new
Like every party is just us two
And there's nothing I could point to
It's everything about you, you, you
Everything about you, you, you
It's everything that you do, do, do
It's everything about you

Guess I like the way you smile
With your eyes
Other guys see it, but don't realize
That it's m-my loving

There's something about your laugh
That makes me wanna have to
There's nothing funny, so
We laugh at n-n-nothing

Every minute's like the last, so
Let's just take it real slow
Forget about the clock
That's tic-tic-ticking

I still feel it every time
It's just something that you do
Now ask me why I want to

It's everything about you, you, you
Everything that you do, do, do
From the way that we touch, baby
To the way that you kiss on me
It's everything about you, you, you
The way you make it feel, new, new, new
Like every party is just us two
And there's nothing I could point to
It's everything about you, you, you
Everything about you, you, you
It's everything that you do, do, do
It's everything about you

And you have always been
The only one I wanted
And I wanted you to know
Without you, I can't face it

All we wanna have is fun
But they say that we're too young
Let them say what they want

It's everything about you, you, you
Everything that you do, do, do
From the way that we touch, baby
To the way that you kiss on me
It's everything about you, you, you
The way you make it feel, new, new, new
Like every party is just us two
And there's nothing I could point to
It's everything about you, you, you
Everything about you, you, you

One Direction,Moments,"Shut the door, turn the light off
I wanna be with you
I wanna feel your love
I wanna lay beside you
I cannot hide this even though I try

Heart beats harder
Time escapes me
Trembling hands touch skin
It makes this harder
And the tears stream down my face

If we could only have this life for one more day
If we could only turn back time

You know I'll be
Your life, your voice, your reason to be
My love, my heart
Is breathing for this
Moment in time
I'll find the words to say
Before you leave me today

Close the door
Throw the key
Don't wanna be reminded
Don't wanna be seen
Don't wanna be without you
My judgement's clouded
Like tonight's sky

Hands are silent
Voice is numb
Try to scream out my lungs
It makes this harder
And the tears stream down my face

If we could only have this life for one more day
If we could only turn back time

You know I'll be
Your life, your voice, your reason to be
My love, my heart
Is breathing for this
Moment in time
I'll find the words to say
Before you leave me today

Flashing lights in my mind
Going back to the time
Playing games in the street
Kicking balls with my feet
There's a numb in my toes
Standing close to the edge
There's a pile of my clothes
At the end of your bed
As I feel myself fall
Make a joke of it all

You know I'll be
Your life, your voice, your reason to be
My love, my heart
Is breathing for this
Moment in time
I'll find the words to say
Before you leave me today

You know I'll be
Your life, your voice your reason to be

Is breathing for this

I know you've never loved
The crinkles by your eyes
When you smile
You've never loved
Your stomach or your thighs
The dimples in your back
At the bottom of your spine
But I'll love them endlessly

I won't let these little things
Slip out of my mouth
But if I do
It's you
Oh it's you
They add up to
I'm in love with you
And all these little things

You can't go to bed
Without a cup of tea
And maybe that's the reason
That you talk in your sleep
And all those conversations
Are the secrets that I keep
Though it makes no sense to me

I know you've never loved the sound of your voice on tape
You never want to know how much weigh
You still have to squeeze into your jeans
But you're perfect to me

I won't let these little things
Slip out of my mouth
But if it's true
It's you
It's you
They add up to
I'm in love with you

You'll never love yourself
Half as much as I love you
You'll never treat yourself right darlin'

You're all I ever wanted
You're giving me a heart attack
OooW!"
One Direction,Rock Me,"Do you remember summer '09?
Want to go back there every night
Just can't lie, it was the best time of my life

Lying on the beach as the sun blew out
Playing this guitar by the fire too loud
Oh my my, they can never shut us down

I used to think that I was better alone
Why did I ever want to let you go?
Under the moonlight as we stared at the sea
The words you whispered I will always believe

I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me yeah
I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me yeah
I want you to hit the pedal, heavy metal
Show me you care
I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me yeah

Yeah we were together summer '09
Want to roll back like pressing rewind
You were mine and we never said goodbye

I used to think that I was better alone (Better alone)
Why did I ever want to let you go? (Let you go)
Under the moonlight as we stared at the sea (Stared at the sea)
The words you whispered I will always believe

I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me yeah
I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me yeah
I want you to hit the pedal, heavy metal

One Direction,Change My Mind,"The end of the night
We should say goodbye
But we carry on
While everyone's gone

Never felt like this before
Are we friends or are we more?
As I'm walking towards the door
I'm not sure

But baby if you say you want me to stay
I'll change my mind
'Cause I don't want to know I'm walking away
If you'll be mine
Won't go, won't go
So baby if you say you want me to stay
Stay for the night
I'll change my mind

Lean in when you laugh
We take photographs
There's no music on
But we dance alone

Never felt like this before
Are we friends or are we more?
As I'm walking towards the door
I'm not sure

But baby if you say you want me to stay
I'll change my mind
'Cause I don't want to know I'm walking away
If you'll be mine
Won't go, won't go
So baby if you say you want me to stay
Stay for the night
I'll change my mind
I'll change my mind

Baby if you say you want me to stay
I'll change my mind

But baby if you say you want me to stay
I'll change my mind
'Cause I don't want to know I'm walking away
If you'll be mine
Won't go, won't go
So baby if you say you want me to stay
Stay for the night
I'll change my mind"
One Direction,I Would,"Lately I found myself thinking
Been dreaming about you a lot
And up in my head I'm your boyfriend
But that's one thing you've already got

He drives to school every morning
While I walk alone in the rain
He'd kill me without any warning
If he took a look in my brain

Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?
Well if it was me then I would, I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low?
Baby you should know that I would, I would

Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?
Well if it was me then I would, I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low?
Baby you should know that I would

Back in my head we were kissing
I thought things were going all right
With a sign on my back saying 'kick me'
Reality ruined my life

It feels like I'm constantly playing
A game that I'm destined to lose
'Cause I can't compete with your boyfriend
He's got 27 tattoos

Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?
Well if it was me then I would, I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low?
Baby you should know that I would, I would

Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?
Well if it was me then I would, I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low?
Baby you should know that I would, I would, I would

Would he please you?
Would he kiss you?
Would he treat you like I would?
Would he touch you?
Would he need you?
Would he love you like I would?

Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?
Well if it was me then I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low?
Baby you should know that I would

Would he please you?
Would he kiss you?
Would he treat you like I would?
Would he touch you?
Would he need you?
Would he love you like I would?

Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?
Well if it was me then I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low?
Baby you should know that I would, I would, I would"
One Direction,Over Again,"Said I'd never leave her
'Cause her hands fit like my t-shirt
Tongue-tied over three words, cursed
Running over thoughts that make my feet hurt
Bodies intertwined with her lips

Now she's feeling so low
Since she went solo
Hole in the middle of my heart like a Polo
And it's no joke to me
So can we do it all over again

If you're pretending from the start like this
With a tight grip, then my kiss
Can mend your broken heart
I might miss everything you said to me
And I could lend you broken parts
That might fit like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over again

Can we take the same road
Two days in the same clothes?
And I know just what she'll say
If I can make all this pain go
Can we stop this for a minute?
You know, I can tell your heart isn't in it or with it

Tell me with your mind, body and spirit
I can make your tears fall down
Like the showers that are British
Whether we're together or apart
We can both remove the masks
And admit we regret it from the start

If you're pretending from the start like this
With a tight grip, then my kiss
Can mend your broken heart
I might miss everything you said to me
And I could lend you broken parts
That might fit like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over again

You'll never know how to make it on your own
And you'll never show weakness for letting go
I guess it's still hard if the seed's sown
But do you really want to be alone?

If you're pretending from the start like this
With a tight grip, then my kiss
Can mend your broken heart
I might miss everything you said to me
And I could lend you broken parts
That might fit like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over again

If you're pretending from the start like this
With a tight grip, then my kiss
Can mend your broken heart
I might miss everything you said to me
And I could lend you broken parts
That might fit like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over again"
One Direction,Back For You,"Whenever I close my eyes I picture you there
I'm looking out at the crowd
You're everywhere
I'm watching you from the stage, yeah
Your smile is on every face now
But every time you wake up
You're hearing me say
Goodbye

Baby, you don't have to worry
I'll be coming back for you
Back for you, back for you, you
Lately I've been going crazy
So I'm coming back for you
Back for you, back for you, you

I've never been so into somebody before
And every time we both touch
I only want more
So tell me nothing's gonna change, yeah
And you won't ever walk away, yeah

You'll know what I'll say
Goodbye

One Direction,They Don't Know About Us,"People say we shouldn't be together
We're too young to know about forever
But I say they don't know
What they're talk talk talking about

'Cause this love is only getting stronger
So I don't want to wait any longer
I just want to tell the world
That you're mine, girl, oh

They don't know about the things we do
They don't know about the ""I love you""s
But I bet you if they only knew
They would just be jealous of us
They don't know about the up all nights
They don't know I've waited all my life
Just to find a love that feels this right
Baby they don't know about
They don't know about us

One touch and I was a believer
Every kiss, it gets a little sweeter

It's getting better
Keeps getting better all the time, girl

They don't know about the things we do
They don't know about the ""I love you""s
But I bet you if they only knew

Just to find a love that feels this right
Baby they don't know about
They don't know about us

They don't know how special you are
They don't know what you've done to my heart
They can say anything they want
'Cause they don't know us

They don't know what we do best
It's between me and you, our little secret
But I want to tell 'em
I want to tell the world that you're mine, girl

They don't know about the things we do
They don't know about the ""I love you""s (I love you!)
But I bet you if they only knew (If they only knew)

One Direction,Summer Love,"Yeah
Ooh, ooh

Can't believe you're packing your bags
Trying so hard not to cry
Had the best time and now it's the worst time
But we have to say goodbye

Don't promise that you're gonna write
Don't promise that you'll call
Just promise that you won't forget we had it all

'Cause you were mine for the summer
Now we know it's nearly over
Feels like snow in September
But I always will remember
You were my summer love
You always will be my summer love

Wish that we could be alone now
If we could find some place to hide
Make the last time just like the first time
Push a button and rewind

Don't say the word that's on your lips
Don't look at me that way
Just promise you will remember when the sky is gray

'Cause you were mine for the summer
Now we know it's nearly over
Feels like snow in September
But I always will remember
You were my summer love
You always will be my summer love

So please don't make this any harder
We can't take this any farther
And I know there's nothing that I wanna change, change

'Cause you were mine for the summer
Now we know it's nearly over
Feels like snow in September
But I always will remember
You were my summer love (Summer love!)
You always will be my summer love (Summer love)
You always will be my summer love
You always will be my summer love"
One Direction,She's Not Afraid,"Yeah!
1 2 3 4!

She sneaks out in the middle of the night, yeah
Tight dress with the top cut low
She's addicted to the feeling of letting go
Oh woah, let it go

She walks in and the room just lights up
But she don't want anyone to know
That I'm the only one that gets to take her home
Oh, take her home

But every time I tell her that I want more
She closes the door

She's not afraid of all the attention
She's not afraid of running wild
How come she's so afraid of falling in love?
She's not afraid of scary movies
She likes the way we kiss in the dark
But she's so afraid of fa-fa-falling in love, love

Maybe she's just trying to test me
Want to see how hard I'm gonna work
Want to see if I can really tell 
How much she's worth (What'cha worth)

Or maybe all of her friends have told her 
Don't get closer, he'll just break your heart
But either way she's teasing me
And it's just so hard (So hard)

'Cause every time I tell her how I feel
She says it's not real

She's not afraid of all the attention
She's not afraid of running wild
How come she's so afraid of falling in love?
She's not afraid of scary movies
She likes the way we kiss in the dark
But she's so afraid of fa-fa-falling in love, love

What about all the the things we say
Talking on the phone so late
I can't let her get away from me, oh

When I say that I can't do it no more
She's back at my door, she's not afraid!

She's not afraid of all the attention
She's not afraid of running wild (Running wild)
How come she's so afraid of falling in love? (Falling in love)
She's not afraid of scary movies (She's not afraid)
She likes the way we kiss in the dark (Kiss in the dark)
But she's so afraid of fa-fa-falling in love, love

She's not afraid

One Direction,Loved You First,"Girl, that should be me
Driving to your house
Knocking on your door
Kissing you on the mouth

Holding on your hand
Dancing in the dark
'Cause I was the only one
Who loved you from the start

But now when I see you with him
It tears my world apart

Because I've been waiting
All this time to finally say it
But now I see your heart's been taken
And nothing could be worse
Baby, I loved you first
Had my chances
Could have been where he is standing
That's what hurts the most
Girl, I came so close
But now you'll never know
Baby, I loved you first

Girl, it should be me
Calling on your phone
Saying you're the one
And that I'll never let you go

I never understood
What love was really like
But I felt it for the first time
Looking in your eyes

But now when I see you with him
My whole world falls apart

Because I've been waiting
All this time to finally say it
But now I see your heart's been taken
And nothing could be worse
Baby, I loved you first
Had my chances
Could have been where he is standing

Are you tearing me apart, tearing me apart?
You're tearing me apart

Did I do something stupid?
Yeah girl, if I blew it
Just tell me what I did

But even if that's true
No one in the world could stop me from not moving on
Baby even if I wanted to
Nobody compares to you

Said I had a dirty mouth (I had a dirty mouth)

One Direction,You & I,"I figured it out
I figured it out from black and white
Seconds and hours
Maybe they had to take some time

I know how it goes
I know how it goes from wrong and right
Silence and sound
Did they ever hold each other tight like us?
Did they ever fight like us?

You and I
We don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'til the end
Nothing can come between you and I
Not even the Gods above can separate the two of us
No nothing can come between you and I
Oh, you and I

I figured it out
Saw the mistakes of up and down
Meet in the middle
There's always room for common ground

I see what it's like
I see what it's like for day and night
Never together
'Cause they see things in a different light like us
But they never tried like us

You and I
We don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'til the end
Nothing can come between you and I
Not even the Gods above can separate the two of us

We don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'til the end
Nothing can come between you and I

One Direction,Don't Forget Where You Belong,"Been a lot of places
I've been all around the world
Seen a lot of faces
Never knowing where I was
On the horizon
Well I know, I know, I know, I know
The sun will be rising back home

Living out of cases
Packing up and taking off
Made a lot of changes
But not forgetting who I was
On the horizon
Oh well I know, I know, I know, I know
The moon will be rising back home

Don't forget where you belong, home
Don't forget where you belong, home
If you ever feel alone, don't
You were never on your own
And the proof is in this song

I've been away for ages
But I got everything I need
I'm flicking through the pages
I've written in my memory
I feel like I'm dreaming
Oh, so I know, I know, I know, I know
That I'm never leaving
No, I won't go

Don't forget where you belong, home
Don't forget where you belong, home
If you ever feel alone, don't
You were never on your own
And the proof is in this song

Lights off when they should be on
Even stars in the skies they're wrong

Short days when the nights are long
When I think of the things I've done

Don't matter how far I've gone
(I'm always free to run home)

Don't forget where you belong, home
Don't forget where you belong, home (Don't forget it)
If you ever feel alone, don't
You were never on your own
Never, never, never!

Don't forget where you belong, home
Don't forget where you belong, home (Don't forget it)
If you ever feel alone, don't
You were never on your own (You were never)
And the proof is in this song

Home, don't forget it
Home, If you ever feel alone, don't
You were never on your own (You were never!)
And the proof is in this song

Never forget it, this song
Don't forget it
No I'll never forget it, this song
You were never..."
One Direction,Strong,"My hands, your hands
Tied up like two ships drifting
Weightless, waves try to break it
I'd do anything to save it
Why is it so hard to say it?

My heart, your heart
Sit tight like bookends
Pages between us
Written with no end
So many words we're not saying
Don't wanna wait 'til it's gone
You make me strong

I'm sorry if I say, ""I need you""
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker
Is that so wrong?
Is it so wrong?
That you make me strong

Think of how much love that's been wasted
People always try to escape it
Move on to stop their heart breaking
But there's nothing I'm running from
You make me strong

I'm sorry if I say, ""I need you""
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker
Is that so wrong?
Is it so wrong?

So baby hold on to my heart, oh
Need you to keep me from falling apart
I'll always hold on
'Cause you make me strong

I'm sorry if I say, ""I need you""
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker
Is that so wrong?
Is it so wrong?

I'm sorry if I say, ""I need you""
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker
Is that so wrong?
Is it so wrong?
That you make me strong

I'm sorry if I say, ""I need you""
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love

Is that so wrong?
Is it so wrong?
That you make me strong"

One Direction,Something Great,"One day you'll come into my world and say it all
You say we'll be together even when you're lost

One day you'll say these words I've thought but never said
You say we're better off together in our bed

Like how I pictured it
So I don't have to keep imagining
Come on, jump out at me
Come on, bring everything
Is it too much to ask for something great?

The script was written and I could not change a thing
I want to rip it all to shreds and start again

One day I'll come into your world and get it right
I'll say we're better off together here tonight

Standing out from the list of the things I've done
All the rest of my crimes don't come close
To the look on your face when I let you go

So I built you a house from a broken home
And I wrote you a song with the words you spoke

How to fix up a heart that I let down

Now I'm searching every lonely place
Every corner calling out your name
Tryna find you but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go?
Where do broken hearts go?

Yeah, a taste of your lips on the tip of my tongue
It's at the top of the list of the things I want
Mind is running in circles of you and me
Anyone in between is the enemy

Shadows come with the pain that you're running from
Love was something you've never heard enough

How to fix up a heart that I let down

Or are you giving it to someone else?
Trying to find you but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go?

A long way from the playground

I have loved you since we were eighteen
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved, to be in love
All I can do is say that these arms were made for holding you
I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were eighteen

We took a chance
God knows we tried
Yet all along, I knew we'd be fine

So pour me a drink oh love
Let's split the night wide open and we'll see everything
We can live in love in slow motion, motion, motion

Driving too fast
Moon is breaking through her hair
She's heading for something that she won't forget
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

We're only getting older, baby
And I been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes

Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change
Me and you

Chasing it tonight, doubts are running 'round her head
He's waiting, hides behind a cigarette
Heart is beating loud, and she doesn't want it to stop

Moving too fast

She's falling, doesn't even know it yet
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

But we never prayed
We had it all, yeah
And we walked away

Point of no return and now
It's just too late to turn around
I try to forgive you
But I struggle 'cause I don't know how
We built it up so high and now I'm fallin'
It's a long way down
It's a long way down, from here

We had a mountain
But took it for granted
We had a spaceship
But we couldn't land it
We found an island
But we got stranded
We had it all
Who could've planned it?

Point of no return and now
It's just too late to turn around
I try to forgive you
But I'm struggling 'cause I don't know how

One Direction,Olivia,"Remember the day we were giving up
When you told me I didn't give you enough
And all of your friends were saying I'd be leaving you

Just thinking how I went about it wrong

Please believe me, don't you see
The things you mean to me?
Oh I love you, I love you

Say what you're feeling and say it now
'Cause I got the feeling you're walking out
And time is irrelevant when I've not been seeing you
The consequences are falling now
There's something I'm having nightmares about
And these are the reasons I'm crying out to be with you

But there's no question, she's not in a disguise

With no way out and a long way down
Everybody needs someone around
And I can't hold you too close now
Through the wire, through the wire

What a feeling to be right here beside you now
Holding you in my arms, when the air ran out
And we both started running wild, the sky fell down
But you've got stars they're in your eyes
And I've got something missing tonight
What a feeling to be a king beside you somehow
I wish I could be there now

Through the wire, through the wire, through the wire
I'm watching you like this, imagining you're mine
It's too late, it's too late, am I too late?
Tell me now, am I running out of time?

""Do you believe I'll never be too far""

Fact that we can sit right here and say goodbye
Means we've already won
A necessity for apologies between you and me

We had some good tricks up our sleeve
Goodbyes are bittersweet
But it's not the end
I'll see your face again

You will find me
And you will find me
In places that we've never been
For reasons we don't understand
Walking in the wind

Yesterday I went out to celebrate the birthday of a friend
But as we raised our glasses up to make a toast
I realized you were missing

We had some good times, didn't we?
We wore our hearts out on our sleeve
Goodbyes are bittersweet
But it's not the end
I'll see your face again

You will find me
And you will find me
In places that we've never been
For reasons we don't understand

Speaking my lesson from the brain

You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like falling
Gravity can't forget
To pull me back to the ground again

Feels like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
The risk that I'm takin'
I'm never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo (halo) halo
I can see your halo (halo) halo
I can feel your halo (halo) halo
I can see your halo (halo) halo
Halooo, ooh
Halooo, ooh
Halooo, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo (halo) halo
I can see your halo (halo) halo
I can feel your halo (halo) halo
I can see your halo (halo) halo"
James Arthur,Impossible,"[Verse 1]
I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love 
I did
And You were strong and I was not
My illusion, my mistake
I was careless I forgot
I did

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And now when all is done
There is nothing to say
You have gone and so effortlessly
You have won
You can go ahead tell them

[Chorus]
Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops
Write it on the sky line
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible

[Verse 2]
Falling out of love is hard
Falling for betrayal is worst
Broken trust and broken hearts
I know, I know
Thinking all you need is there
Building faith on love and words
Empty promises will wear
I know, I know

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And now when all is gone
There is nothing to say
And if you're done with embarrassing me
On your own you can go ahead tell them

[Chorus]
Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops
Write it on the sky line
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible

[Bridge]
I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love
I did

[Outro]
Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops
Write it on the sky line
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy 
And my heart is broken
I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible"

Mama, come here
Approach, appear

Isaiah,It's Gotta Be You,"I hear a million voices in my head
Telling me things I should have said
I don't know why I let you go
Oh, I learned the hard way
Tell me it's not to late

Now my arms are open wide
They're hanging forever there
Waiting forever for you
I won't give up on you this time
'Cause I ain't holding on, for nobody else

It's gotta be you
When you walked away my heart tried to replace ya
With someone like you
But I could never find it
I don't want to find it
It's gotta be you

I wish I could turn back the time
The power is yours and never mine
Maybe with time you'll see that
I can give you all the things you missed
Oh, no, no

Now my arms are open wide
And I ain't holding on, for nobody else

It's gotta be you
When you walked away my heart tried to replace ya
With someone like you
But I could never find it
I don't want to find it
It's gotta be you

You don't have to answer right now
Baby, go and take your time
'Cause I'll be here

It's gotta be you
It's gotta be you
It's gotta be you

When you walked away my heart tried to replace ya
With someone like you
But I could never find it
I don't want to find it

It's gotta be you
It's gotta be you

I don't want nobody else
Nobody else but you
Oh, it's gotta be you"
Richard Marx,Right Here Waiting,"Oceans apart day after day
And I slowly go insane
I hear your voice on the line
But it doesn't stop the pain

If I see you next to never
How can we say forever

Wherever you go, whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I took for granted, all the times
That I thought would last somehow
I hear the laughter, I taste the tears
But I can't get near you now

Oh, can't you see it, baby
You've got me goin' crazy

Wherever you go, whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I wonder how we can survive this romance
But in the end if I'm with you
I'll take the chance

Oh, can't you see it, baby
You've got me goin' crazy

Wherever you go, whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you, waiting for you"
Alex & Sierra,Little Do You Know,"Little do you know
How I'm breaking while you fall asleep
Little do you know
I'm still haunted by the memory
Little do you know
I'm trying to pick myself up piece by piece
Little do you know
I need a little more time
Underneath it all I'm held captive by the hole inside
I've been holding back for the feel that you might change your mind
I'm ready to forgive you but forgetting is a harder fight
Little do you know
I need a little more time

I'll wait, I'll wait
I love you like you've never felt the pain, I'll wait
I promise you don't have to be afraid, I'll wait
The love you see is right here to stay so lay your head on me
Little do you know
I know you're hurting while I'm sound asleep
Little do you know
All my mistakes are slowly drowning me
Little do you know
I'm trying to make it better piece by piece
Little do you know
I love you till the sun dies

Oh wait, just wait
I love you like I've never felt the pain, just wait
I love you like I've never been afraid, just wait
Our love we see right here stays so lay your head on me

I'll wait, I'll wait
I love you like you've never felt the pain, I'll wait
I promise you don't have to be afraid, I'll wait
The love you see right here stays so lay your head on me
Lay your head on me
So lay your head on me
'Cause little do you know
I love you till the sun dies"
Adele,Rolling in the Deep,"There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringin' me out the dark

Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare

See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do

There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringin' me out the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all

The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn

Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there as mine sure won't be shared

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love remind me of us
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
I can't help feeling

We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Could have had it all
Rolling in the deep

You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating

Throw your soul through every open door (Wohh ho ho oh)
Count your blessings to find what you look for (Wohh oh oh oh)

Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (Wohh ho ho oh)
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
We could have had it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
It all, it all, it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We drew a map to a better place
But on that road I took a fall
Oh baby, why did you run away?

I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest nights

Maroon 5,It Was Always You,"Woke up sweating from a dream
With a different kind of feeling
All day long my heart was beating
Searching for the meaning

Hazel eyes,
I was so color blind
We were just wasting time
For my whole life
We never crossed the line
Only friends in my mind
But now I realize

It was always you
Can't believe I could not see it all this time, all this time
It was always you
Now I know why my heart wasn't satisfied, satisfied
It was always you, you
No more guessing who
Looking back now I know it was always you, always you

All my hidden desires
Finally came alive
No, I never told lies
To you so why would I
Start tonight

Best laid plans sometimes are just a one night stand
I'd be damned Cupid's demanding back his arrow
So let's get drunk on our tears and...

God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run
Searching for meaning
But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?

Who are we? Just a speck of dust within the galaxy?
Woe is me, if we're not careful, turns into reality
Don't you dare let our best memories bring you sorrow
Yesterday I saw a lion kiss a deer
Turn the page maybe we'll find a brand new ending
Where we're dancing in our tears and...

God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run
Searching for meaning
But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?

I thought I saw you out there crying
I thought I heard you call my name
I thought I heard you out there crying
Just the same

God, give us the reason youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season and this lamb is on the run
Searching for meaning

That someday it would lead me back to you 
That someday it would lead me back to you 

That may be all I need 
In darkness, she is all I see 
Come and rest your bones with me 
Driving slow on Sunday morning 
And I never want to leave

Paint a picture with my hands

Change the weather, still together when it ends

Driving slow on Sunday morning

And her heart is breakin' in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore
Whoa, whoa, whoa

I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied

Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again

She said goodbye too many times before

And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

Repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's all right (It's all right, it's all right)
My pressure on your hips
I'm sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you
'Cause I know that's what you want me to do

Where have the times gone

Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember the people we used to be
It's even harder to picture that you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it but is it too late to try
And in that time that you wasted, all of our bridges burned down

I've wasted my nights, you turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change, I spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby, it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two

If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
And all those fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song I'll be sick, oh

You turned your back on tomorrow, 'cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow, but you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine, I don't expect you to care

Man, fuck that shit, I'll be out spending all this money
While you sitting around wondering
Why it wasn't you who came up from nothing
Made it from the bottom, now when you see me I'm stunnin'

And all of my cars start with the push of a button
Telling me I changed since I blew up or whatever you call it
Switched the number to my phone so you never could call it
Don't need my name on my shirt, you can tell that I'm ballin'

Swish, what a shame, coulda got picked
Had a really good game but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top, or what you could've saw
But sad to say it's over for, Phantom pulled up, valet open doors

Wished I go away, got what you was looking for, now It's me who they want
So you can go take that little piece of shit with you

I wish I would have known that wasn't me
'Cause even after all this time I still wonder
Why I can't move on
Just the way you did so easily
Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's holding onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

That we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
Like we used to do
We don't love anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do

I just hope you're lying next to somebody
Who knows how to love you like me
There must be a good reason that you're gone
Every now and then I think you
Might want me to come show up at your door
But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong
Don't wanna know
If you're looking into her eyes
If she's holding onto you so tight the way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

That we don't talk anymore
(We don't we don't)
We don't talk anymore

Like we used to do

Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's giving it to you just right
The way I did before

Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

Wiz Khalifa,See You Again (feat. Charlie Puth),"It's been a long day without you my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

Damn, who knew
All the planes we flew
Good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path
I know we loved to hit the road and laugh

But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up look at things different see the bigger picture
Those were the days
Hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place

Ah
How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (lemme tell you)
When I see you again

Oh, oh, ooh

First, you both go out your way
And the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship
A friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken
The love will never get lost

And when brotherhood come first
Then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own
When that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached
So remember me when I'm gone

How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home

It's been a long day without you my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again

Go

Sí, sabes que ya llevo rato mirándote
Tengo que bailar contigo hoy (DY)
Vi que tu mirada ya estaba llamándome
Muéstrame el camino que yo voy (Oh)

Tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan
Solo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso (Oh yeah)

Ya, ya me está gustando más de lo normal
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo más
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningún apuro

Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oido
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo

Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito

Sube sube
Sube, sube, sube

Quiero ver bailar tu pelo
Quiero ser tu ritmo
Que le enseñes a mi boca
Tus lugares favoritos (Favorito, favorito baby)

Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro
Hasta provocar tus gritos
Y que olvides tu apellido

(Daddy Yankee)

Si te pido un beso ven dámelo
Yo sé que estás pensandolo
Llevo tiempo intentandolo
Mami esto es dando y dandolo
Sabes que tu corazón conmigo te hace bom bom
Sabes que esa beba está buscando de mi bom bom
Ven prueba de mi boca para ver como te sabe
Quiero quiero ver cuanto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empecemos lento, después salvaje
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza

Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas
Pero pa montarlo aquí tengo la pieza

Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oido
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo

Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito

Sube, sube, sube, sube, sube

Quiero ver bailar tu pelo
Quiero ser tu ritmo

Tus lugares favoritos (Favorito, favorito baby)

Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro
Hasta provocar tus gritos
Y que olvides tu apellido

Despacito
Vamos a hacerlo en una playa en Puerto Rico
Hasta que las olas griten Ay Bendito
Para que mi sello se quede contigo

Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Que le enseñes a mi boca
Tus lugares favoritos (Favorito, favorito baby)

Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Hasta provocar tus gritos
Y que olvides tu apellido

Jon Bellion,All Time Low,"I, was the knight in shining armor in your movie

Ronan Keating,When You Say Nothing At All,"It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart
Without saying a word, you can light up the dark
Try as I may, I can never explain
What I hear when you don't say a thing

The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me wherever I fall
You say it best (say it best)
When you say nothing at all

All day long, I can hear people talking out loud
But when you hold me near, you drown out the crowd 
Try as they may, they could never define
What's been said between your heart and mine

The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me wherever I fall
You say it best (say it best)
When you say nothing at all

Oh
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me wherever I fall
You say it best (say it best)
When you say nothing at all

(You say it best when you say nothing at all
You say it best when you say nothing at all)

That smile on your face
The truth in your eyes
The touch of your hand
Lets me know that you need me

You say it best when you say nothing at all)"

That one day I will be, where I was
Right there, right next to you
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
The moon, the stars, are nothing without you
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain, the way I'm missing you
The night, this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
These tears, they tell their own story

You told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
And I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

I'm reaching out to you
Can you hear my call?
This hurt that I've been through
I'm missing you, missing you like crazy, daily

Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
And I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

Denying every tear
I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you here

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

You've been so unavailable
Now sadly I know why
Your heart is unobtainable
Even though God knows you have mine

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

I have loved you for many years
Maybe I am just not enough
You've made me realize my deepest fear
By lying and tearing us up

Passenger,Let Her Go,"Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go

Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day, you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast

You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

But you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast

Well you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep

Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go
And you let her go
Well you let her go

'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

Owl City,Fireflies,"You would not believe your eyes
If ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep

And leave teardrops everywhere

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems

'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs
From ten thousand lightning bugs
As they try to teach me how to dance

A foxtrot above my head
A sock hop beneath my bed
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems

Leave my door open just a crack
(Please take me away from here)
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
(Please take me away from here)
Why do I tire of counting sheep?
(Please take me away from here)
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep

To ten million fireflies
I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell
(They said farewell)

But I'll know where several are
If my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar
(A jar)

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep

One Direction,Story of My Life,"Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain
I leave my heart open, but it stays right here empty for days
She told me in the morning she don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die these words will be written on my stone

And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The ground beneath my feet is open wide
The way that I've been holdin' on too tight
With nothing in between

The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm and time
Is frozen (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life, I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)

Written on these walls are the colours that I can't change
Leave my heart open but it stays right here in its cage
I know that in the morning, I'll see us in the light upon the hill
Although I am broken, my heart is untamed still

And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The fire beneath my feet is burning bright
The way that I've been holdin' on so tight
With nothing in between

The story of my life I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm and time
Is frozen (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)

And I've been waiting for this time to come around
But baby, running after you is like chasing the clouds
The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm and time is frozen

The story of my life I give her hope (Give her hope)
I spend her love until she's broke inside (Until she's broke inside)
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)

Yeah, yeah

Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?
Say yes, say yes, 'cause I need to know
You say I'll never get your blessings till the day I die

I'm gonna marry her anyway

Marry that girl
Marry her anyway

Yeah, no matter what you say

And we'll be a family

Why you gotta be so rude?

I hate to do this, you leave no choice
I can't live without her
Love me or hate me we will be boys
Standing at that altar

Or we will run away
To another galaxy, you know
You know she's in love with me
She will go anywhere I go

Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?
Say yes, say yes, 'cause I need to know
You say I'll never get your blessings till the day I die

Lana Del Rey,Young And Beautiful,"I've seen the world, done it all
Had my cake now
Diamonds, brilliant
And Bel Air now

Hot summer nights, mid-July
When you and I were forever wild
The crazy days, city lights
The way you'd play with me like a child

Will you still love me
When I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me
When I've got nothing but my achin' soul?

I know you will
I know you will
I know that you will
Will you still love me
When I'm no longer beautiful?

I've seen the world, lit it up
As my stage now
Channeling angels in
The new age now

Hot summer days, rock and roll
The way you'd play for me at your show
And all the ways I got to know
Your pretty face and electric soul

Will you still love me
When I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me
When I've got nothing but my achin' soul?

I know you will
I know you will
I know that you will
Will you still love me
When I'm no longer beautiful?

Dear Lord, when I get to Heaven
Please let me bring my man
When he comes, tell me that you'll let him in
Father, tell me if you can

All that grace, all that body
All that face, makes me wanna party
He's my sun, he makes me shine
Like diamonds

Will you still love me
When I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me
When I've got nothing but my achin' soul?

I know you will
I know you will
I know that you will
Will you still love me
When I'm no longer beautiful?

Will you still love me
When I'm no longer beautiful?
Will you still love me
When I'm not young and beautiful?"
Kelly Clarkson,Because of You,"Ooh
Ooh

I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard
I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far

Because of you 
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt

Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

I lose my way and it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh, every day of my life
My heart can't possibly break when it wasn't even whole to start with

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt

Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

I watched you die, I heard you cry every night in your sleep
I was so young, you should have known better than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else, you just saw your pain
And now I cry in the middle of the night for the same damn thing

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt

Because of you
I tried my hardest just to forget everything
Because of you
I don't know how to let anyone else in

Because of you
I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
Because of you
I am afraid

Because of you
Because of you"
Justin Bieber,Home To Mama,"I don't work hard when it's easy
I put in work when it's hard
Girl I never believed in love until I had yours
This is more than a season
And I'm not just sprung
I'm not afraid to tell you that you're the one
The one I wake up thinking about
The one that I can run to when I'm feeling down
Life is so good when you're around
Girl nobody from the past is beating you right now

'Cause I'll take you home to mama, let you meet my friends
'Cause you don't come with drama
So I want you till the world ends
You're way more than worth it
But I don't feel like I deserve it
You got the pieces
You're my kind of perfect

I don't work hard when it's easy
I put in work when it's hard
Girl they never believed in love until I had yours
This is more than a season
And I'm not just sprung
I'm not afraid to tell you that you're the one
I'm the one you wake up thinkin' 'bout

Jasmine Thompson,Ain't Nobody (Loves Me Better) - Acoustic,"Captured effortlessly
That's the way it was
Happened so naturally
I did not know it was love
The next thing I felt was
You holding me close
What was I gonna do?
I let myself go

And now we're flyin' through the stars
I hope this night will last forever

I've been waitin' for you
It's been so long
I knew just what I would do
When I heard your song
You filled my heart with a kiss
Ya gave me freedom
You knew I could not resist
I needed someone

And now we're flyin' through the stars
I hope this night will last forever
Oh oh oh oh

Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody
Loves me better than you

I wait for night time to come
To bring you to me
I can't believe I'm the one
I was so lonely
I feel like no one could feel
I must be dreamin'
I want this dream to be real
I need this feelin'

I make my wish upon a star
And hope this night will last forever

Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody
Loves me better than you

At first you put your arms around me
Then you put your charms around me
I can't resist this sweet surrender
On a night so warm and tender
We stare into each other's eyes
And what we see is no surprise
Got a feeling most with treasure
And a love so deep we cannot measure

Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody
Loves me better than you"
Hozier,Take Me to Church,"My lover's got humour
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner

If the Heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week

We were born sick
You heard them say it

My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, ""Worship in the bedroom""
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you

I was born sick
But I love it
Command me to be well
A-amen, amen, amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the Goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice

Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine lookin' high horse

What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human, only then I am clean

Oh oh
Amen, amen, amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life"
A Great Big World,Say Something,"Say something, I'm giving up on you
I'll be the one, if you want me to
Anywhere, I would've followed you
Say something, I'm giving up on you

And I am feeling so small
It was over my head
I know nothing at all

And I will stumble and fall
I'm still learning to love
Just starting to crawl

Say something, I'm giving up on you
I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you
Anywhere, I would've followed you
Say something, I'm giving up on you

And I will swallow my pride
You're the one that I love

Five For Fighting,Superman (It's Not Easy),"I can't stand to fly
I'm not that naïve
I'm just out to find
The better part of me

I'm more than a bird
I'm more than a plane
More than some pretty face beside a train
And it's not easy to be me

I wish that I could cry
Fall upon my knees
Find a way to lie
'Bout a home I'll never see

It may sound absurd
But don't be naïve
Even heroes have the right to bleed
I may be disturbed
But won't you concede
Even heroes have the right to dream
And it's not easy to be me

Up, up and away, away from me
Well it's alright
You can all sleep sound tonight
I'm not crazy or anything

I can't stand to fly
I'm not that naïve
Men weren't meant to ride
With clouds between their knees

I'm only a man in a silly red sheet
Digging for Kryptonite on this one-way street
Only a man in a funny red sheet
Looking for special things inside of me, inside of me
Inside of me, yeah inside of me, inside of me

I'm only a man in a funny red sheet
I'm only a man looking for a dream
I'm only a man in a funny red sheet
And it's not easy
It's not easy to be me"
Ed Sheeran,Lego House,"I'm gonna pick up the pieces and build a Lego house

And out of all these things I've done

And it's so hard to say it but I've been here before
Now I'll surrender up my heart and swap it for yours

Christina Perri,Jar of Hearts,"I know I can't take one more step towards you
'Cause all that's waiting is regret
And don't you know I'm not your ghost anymore
You lost the love I loved the most

I learned to live half-alive
And now you want me one more time

And who do you think you are, running 'round leaving scars?
Collecting your jar of hearts and tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold from the ice inside your soul
So don't come back for me, who do you think you are?

I hear you're asking all around
If I am anywhere to be found
But I have grown too strong
To ever fall back in your arms

I learned to live half-alive
And now you want me one more time

And who do you think you are, running 'round leaving scars?
Collecting your jar of hearts, tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold from the ice inside your soul
So don't come back for me, who do you think you are?

It took so long just to feel alright
Remember how to put back the light in my eyes
I wish I had missed the first time that we kissed
'Cause you broke all your promises

And now you're back, you don't get to get me back

And who do you think you are, running 'round leaving scars?
Collecting your jar of hearts and tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold from the ice inside your soul
So don't come back for me, don't come back at all

And who do you think you are, running 'round leaving scars?
Collecting your jar of hearts, tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold from the ice inside your soul
Don't come back to me, don't come back at all

Bruno Mars,When I Was Your Man,"Same bed, but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio, but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name
And it all just sound like, ""Oooh.""

Hmmm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should've bought you flowers and held your hand
Should've gave you all my hours when I had the chance
Take you to every party 'cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing, but she's dancing with another man

My pride, my ego, my needs and my selfish ways
Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made, oh
And that haunts me every time I close my eyes
It all just sounds like, ""Oooh.""

Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should've bought you flowers and held your hand
Should've gave all my hours when I had the chance
Take you to every party 'cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing, but she's dancing with another man

Although it hurts I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know

I hope he buys you flowers, I hope he holds your hands
Give you all his hours when he has the chance
Take you to every party 'cause I remember how much you loved to dance
Do all the things I should've done when I was your man
Do all the things I should've done when I was your man"
Boyce Avenue,What Makes You Beautiful,"You're insecure
Don't know what for
You're turning heads when you walk through the door
Don't need make up
To cover up
Being the way that you are is enough

Everyone else but you

Baby you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know
You don't know you're beautiful
That's what makes you beautiful

So girl come on
You got it wrong
To prove I'm right I put it in a song
I don't why
You're being shy
And turn away when I look in your eyes

Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you

Baby you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know
You don't know you're beautiful

You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know
You don't know you're beautiful
You don't know you're beautiful

And that's what makes you beautiful!>"
Adele,When We Were Young,"Everybody loves the things you do

You're like a dream come true

But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment
Before I go?

'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know

You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized

We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

I was so scared to face my fears
'Cause nobody told me
That you'd be here

And I swear you moved overseas
That's what you said, when you left me

You still look like a movie
You still sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time

It's hard to win me back
Everything just takes me back
To when you were there
To when you were there

And a part of me keeps holding on
Just in case it hasn't gone
I guess I still care
Do you still care?

It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

Oh, I'm so mad I'm getting old

It makes me reckless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
When we were young"

Adele,Set Fire to the Rain,"I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark, and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me

My hands, they were strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true
And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name

When I lay with you
I could stay there, close my eyes
Feel you here, forever
You and me together, nothing is better

'Cause there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true
And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When we fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time

Sometimes I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you

I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When we fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time

Burn, oh
Oh, no
Let it burn, oh
Let it burn
Let it burn"
Adam Levine,Lost Stars,"Please don't see just a boy caught up in dreams and fantasies
Please see me reaching out for someone I can't see
Take my hand let's see where we wake up tomorrow
Best laid plans sometimes are just a one night stand
I'd be damned Cupid's demanding back his arrow
So let's get drunk on our tears and...

God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run
Searching for meaning
But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?

Who are we? Just a speck of dust within the galaxy?
Woe is me, if we're not careful, turns into reality
Don't you dare let our best memories bring you sorrow
Yesterday I saw a lion kiss a deer
Turn the page maybe we'll find a brand new ending
Where we're dancing in our tears and...

God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run
Searching for meaning
But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?

I thought I saw you out there crying
I thought I heard you call my name
I thought I heard you out there crying
Just the same

God, give us the reason youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season and this lamb is on the run
Searching for meaning
But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?

I thought I saw you out there crying
I thought I heard you call my name
I thought I heard you out there crying
But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?
But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?"
John Legend,All of Me,"What would I do without your smart mouth
Drawing me in and you kicking me out?
Got my head spinning, no kidding
I can't pin you down

What's going on in that beautiful mind?
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me
But I'll be alright

My head's underwater
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm outta my mind

'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me, I'll gives my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I'm winning

'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh

How many times do I have to tell you
Even when you're crying, you're beautiful too?
The world is beating you down
I'm around through every mood

You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing
This ringing in my head for you

My head's underwater
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I'm winning

'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all, all of you

Cards on the table
We're both showing hearts
Risking it all though it's hard

'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I'm winning

'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh
I give you all of me, yeah
And you give me all of you, oh"
Family of the Year,Hero,"Let me go
I don't wanna be your hero
I don't wanna be a big man
Just wanna fight with everyone else

Your masquerade
I don't wanna be a part of your parade
Everyone deserves a chance to
Walk with everyone else

While holding down
A job to keep my girl around
And maybe buy me some new strings
And her a night out on the weekends

And we can whisper things
Secrets from our American dreams
Baby needs some protection
But I'm a kid like everyone else

So let me go
I don't wanna be your hero
I don't wanna be a big man
I just wanna fight like everyone else

Nobody matters like you""

You're gonna grow and have a good life

Cause any obstacle come you're well prepared
And no mama, you never set tear
Cause you have to set things year and to year
And you give the youth love beyond compare
You find his school fee and the bus fare
Mmm Marie, the paps' disappear
In the round back can't find him nowhere
Steadily you work flow, everything you know
You know say you nuh stop the time fi a jear

Now she gotta a six year old
Trying to keep him warm
Trying to keep out the cold
When he looks her in the eyes
He don't know he's safe

When she says ""uh, love, no one's ever gonna hurt you, love
I'm gonna give you all of my love
Nobody matters like you""

So, Rockabye baby, Rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye baby, don't you cry
Somebody's got you
Rockabye baby, Rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye baby, don't you cry
Bidda-bang-bang-bang, alright then
Rockabye, no
Rockabye-rocka-rocka-rocka-bye
Rockabye, oh oh yeah
Rockabye-rocka-rocka-rocka-bye

Now she gotta a six year old
Trying to keep him warm
Trying to keep out the cold
When he looks her in the eyes
He don't know he's safe when she says

She tells him ""uh, love, no one's ever gonna hurt you, love
I'm gonna give you all of my love
Nobody matters like you""
She tells him ""your life ain't gonna be nothing like my life
You're gonna grow and have a good life
I'm gonna do what I've got to do""

So, Rockabye baby, Rockabye
Rockabye-rocka-rocka-rocka-bye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye baby, don't you cry
Rockabye-rocka-rocka-rocka-bye

Justin Timberlake,"CAN'T STOP THE FEELING! (Original Song from DreamWorks Animation's ""TROLLS"")","I got this feeling inside my bones
It goes electric, wavey when I turn it on
All through my city, all through my home
We're flying up, no ceiling, when we in our zone

I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops (ooh)
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
Room on lock the way we rock it, so don't stop

Under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine (just imagine, just imagine)

Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
Feeling good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing

I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance, come on

Ooh, it's something magical
It's in the air, it's in my blood, it's rushing on
I don't need no reason, don't need control
I fly so high, no ceiling, when I'm in my zone

'Cause I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops (ooh)
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally

Shawn Mendes,Treat You Better,"I won't lie to you
I know he's just not right for you
And you can tell me if I'm off
But I see it on your face
When you say that he's the one that you want
And you're spending all your time
In this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop

I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time on all your wasted crime
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can

I'll stop time for you
The second you say you'd like me to
I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
Baby, just to wake up with you
It'd be everything I need and this could be so different
Tell me what you want to do

'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time on all your wasted crime
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
Better than he can

Give me a sign, take my hand, we'll be fine
Promise I won't let you down
Just know that you don't have to do this alone
Promise I'll never let you down

I know I can treat you better
I know I can treat you better
I know I can treat you better
Promise I'll never let you down

'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time on all your wasted crime

Shawn Mendes,Mercy,"You've got a hold of me
Don't even know your power
I stand a hundred feet
But I fall when I'm around you

Show me an open door
Then you go and slam it on me
I can't take anymore
I'm saying baby

Please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart

I'd drive through the night
Just to be near you, baby
Heart old and testified
Tell me that I'm not crazy

I'm not asking for a lot
Just that you're honest with me
My pride is all I got
I'm saying baby

Please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy on me
I'm a puppet on your string
And even though you got good intentions
I need you to set me free
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart

Consuming all the air inside my lungs
Ripping all the skin from off my bones
I'm prepared to sacrifice my life
I would gladly do it twice
Consuming all the air inside my lungs
Ripping all the skin from off my bones
I'm prepared to sacrifice my life
I would gladly do it twice

Please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy on me

DJ Snake,Let Me Love You,"I used to believe
We were burnin' on the edge of somethin' beautiful
Somethin' beautiful
Sellin' a dream
Smoke and mirrors keep us waitin' on a miracle
On a miracle

Say, go through the darkest of days
Heaven's a heartbreak away
Never let you go, never let me down
Oh, it's been a hell of a ride
Driving the edge of a knife
Never let you go, never let me down

Don't you give up
I won't give up
Let me love you
Let me love you
Don't you give up
I won't give up
Let me love you
Let me love you
Oh baby, baby

Don't fall asleep
At the wheel, we've got a million miles ahead of us
Miles ahead of us
All that we need
Is a rude awakening to know we're good enough
Know we're good enough

Say go through the darkest of days
Heaven's a heartbreak away
Never let you go, never let me down
Oh it's been a hell of a ride
Driving the edge of a knife
Never let you go, never let me down

Don't you give up
I won't give up
Let me love you
Let me love you
Don't you give up
I won't give up
Let me love you
Let me love you
Oh baby, baby

Don't you give up
I won't give up
Let me love you
Let me love you
Don't you give up
I won't give up
Let me love you
Let me love you
Oh baby, baby"
Ed Sheeran,Castle on the Hill,"When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
Tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass as I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I
Found my heart and broke it here, made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know, I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way, driving at ninety down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer, and I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Fifteen years old smoking hand rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when we found
Weekend jobs when we got paid we'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way, driving at ninety down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer, and I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
Ones already on his second wife
Ones just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

And I'm on my way, I still remember these old country lanes
When we did not know the answers, and I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill"
The Civil Wars,Poison & Wine,"You only know what I want you to
I know everything you don't want me to
Your mouth is poison, your mouth is wine
You think your dreams are the same as mine

Ooh, I don't love you, but I always will
Oh, I don't love you, but I always will
I don't love you, but I always will
I always will

I wish you'd hold me when I turn my back
The less I give, the more I get back
Ooh, your hands can heal, your hands can bruise
I don't have a choice, but I still choose you

Ooh, I don't love you, but I always will
Oh, I don't love you, but I always will
I don't love you, but I always will
Oh, I don't love you, but I always will

I don't love you, but I always will
I don't love you, but I always will
I don't love you, but I always will
I always will

I always will
I always will
I always will
I always will"
Lotte Kestner,Halo,"Remember those walls I built
Well, baby they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound

I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace

You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby I can see your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I can see your halo halo

Hit me like a ray of sun
Burning through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
And I'm addicted to your light

I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like falling
Gravity can't forget
To pull me back to the ground again
Feels like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
The risk that I'm takin'
I'm never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace

You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

Halo halo halo halo
I can feel your halo
I can see your halo
I can feel your halo
I can see your halo
Halo"
James Bay,Let It Go,"From walking home and talking loads
To seeing shows in evening clothes with you
From nervous touch to getting drunk
To staying up and waking up with you

But now we're sleeping at the edge
Holding something we don't need
All this delusion in our heads
Is gonna bring us to our knees

So come on let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

Everything's that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

And I'll be me

From throwing clothes across the floor
To teeth and claws and slamming doors at you
If this is all we're living for
Why are we doing it, doing it, doing it anymore

I used to recognize myself
It's funny how reflections change
When we're becoming something else
I think it's time to walk away

So come on let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

Everything's that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

And I'll be me

Trying to fit your hand inside of mine
When we know it just don't belong
There's no force on earth
Could make me feel right, no

Whoa

Trying to push this problem up the hill
When it's just too heavy to hold
Think now's the time to let it slide

So come on let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

Everything's that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Let the ashes fall
Forget about me

Come on let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

And I'll be me"
James Arthur,Say You Won't Let Go,"I met you in the dark
You lit me up
You made me feel as though
I was enough
We danced the night away
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest

I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I know I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me
When I needed you most

I'm gonna love you till
My lungs give out
I promise till death we part
Like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you
Now everybody knows
That it's just you and me
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

Just say you won't let go
Oh, just say you won't let go"

Ed Sheeran,Photograph,"Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
Time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home

Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of you, mmm
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die

Mmm, we keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
Time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me
That's okay baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

Oh you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me
Well that's okay baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth Street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
Wait for me to come home"
Adele,Someone Like You,"I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited  
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead 
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah

You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited  
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah

Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you 
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead 

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead 
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah..."
Calum Scott,Dancing On My Own - Acoustic,"Somebody said you got a new friend
Does she love you better than I can?

I just gotta see it for myself

I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, o ooh
I'm right over here, why can't you see me, o ooh
And I'm giving it all my, but I'm not the guy you're taking home, ooh
I keep dancing on my own

I'm just gonna dance all night
I'm all messed up, I'm so out of line, yeah
Stilettos and broken bottles
I'm spinning around in circles
I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, o ooh
I'm right over here, why can't you see me, o ooh
And I'm giving it my all, but I'm not the guy you're taking home, ooh
I keep dancing on my own
And oh no

So far away but still so near
The lights come up, the music dies
But you don't see me standing here
I just came to say goodbye

Adele,Make You Feel My Love,"When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I will never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong

I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
And I'd go crawling down the avenue
No there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me, yet

I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
To make you feel my love
To make you feel my love"
Nathan Sykes,Over And Over Again,"From the way you smile

But I do, I do

I just want to love you when the goings tough

I do, I do

I just want to touch your soul
I do, I do

I just want to hold you when the goings tough
I just want to love you when you're not enough
I just want to give you all that I can give
I do, I do

I just want to kiss you in the morning sun
I just want to love you when the day is done
I just want to hold you just because I can
I do, I do

I just want to fold you up into my arms
I just want to listen to your beating heart
I just want to love you just because I do
I do, I do"
Lady Gaga,Million Reasons,"You're giving me a million reasons to let you go
You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show

If you could find a dry way, I'd forever be still
But you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away

Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare
It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

And if you say something that you might even mean
It's hard to even fathom which parts I should believe
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay

Hey, eh, eh, ey
Baby I'm bleedin', bleedin'
Stay, eh, ehhy
Can't you give me what I'm needin', needin'
Every heartbreak makes it hard to keep the faith
But baby, I just need one good one
Good one, good one, good one, good one, good one

When I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all this worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one, good one
Tell me that you'll be the good one, good one
Baby, I just need one good one to stay"
The Vamps,All Night,"I been up all night, no sleep
'Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming
All night, no sleep
'Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming
'Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming

Sometimes I tend to lose myself when I'm out here on my own
I never seem to get it right, but I guess that is how it goes
Ever since you came around, can't nobody hold me down
You showed me how to find myself when I needed it the most

I been up all night, no sleep
'Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming
All night, no sleep
'Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming
Wide awake, that's okay as long as I'm with you
I'll be up all night, no sleep
'Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming

I'm never gonna find my way
If I don't run to that goal
The past is the past, today is today
And there are things I can't control
The circles underneath my eyes
Tell the truth I've been trying to hide
I've been waiting for you way too long
Won't you come and take me home
Oh I, I'm praying this ain't all a dream
Can you, you, wake me up before you leave

I been up all night, no sleep
'Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming
All night, no sleep
'Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming
Wide awake, that's okay as long as I'm with you
I'll be up all night, no sleep
'Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming"
Machine Gun Kelly,Bad Things - With Camila Cabello,"Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say, it's complicated
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated

Nothing's that bad
If it feels good
So you come back
Like I knew you would
And we're both wild
And the night's young
And you're my drug
Breathe you in 'til my face numb
Drop it down to that bass drum
I got what you dream about
Nails scratchin' my back tatt
Eyes closed while you scream out
And you keep me in with those hips
While my teeth sink in those lips
While your body's giving me life
And you suffocate in my kiss
Then you said

I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever

Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say, it's complicated
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated

I can't explain it
I love the pain
And I love the way your breath
Numbs me of Novocaine
And we are
Always high
Keep it strange
Okay, yeah, I'm insane
But you the same
Let me paint the picture
Couch by the kitchen
Nothin' but your heels on
Losin' our religion
You're my pretty little vixen
And I'm the voice inside your head
That keeps telling you to listen to all the bad things I say
And you said

I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever

Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say, it's complicated
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated

The way we love, is so unique
And when we touch, I'm shivering
And no one has to get it
Just you and me
'Cause we're just living
Between the sheets

I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever

Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say, it's complicated
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated"
Major Lazer,Cold Water (feat. Justin Bieber & MØ),"Everybody gets high sometimes, ya know?

Owl City,The Bird And The Worm,"If you're the bird whenever we pretend it's summer
Then I'm the worm, I know the part is such a bummer
But fair is fair, if my segments get separated
I'll scream and you'll be there

Close your eyes (close my eyes)
Slide the cotton off of your shoulder 
And feel the shine (feel the shine)
On the hook, so toss me over and cast the line (we'll all try)
I'll throw a party and greet my undersea friends (it depends)
As they arrive (if they arrive)

You and I left our troubles far behind (troubles far behind)
But I still have just one more question on my mind
For all my pals who live in the oceans and the seas
With friends like these, well who needs enemies?

If I'm your boy, let's take a shortcut we remember
And we'll enjoy picking apples in late September
Like we've done for years 
Then we'll take a long walk through the cornfield 
Then I'll kiss you between the ears

If you're my girl, swirl me around your room with feeling
And as we twirl the glow in the dark stars on your ceiling
Will shine for us as love sweeps over the room 'cause we tend to
Make each other blush (you make me blush)

You and I left our troubles far behind (troubles far behind)
But I still have just one more question on my mind
For all my pals who live in the oceans and the seas
With fronds like these, well who needs anemones?

You're the bird, I'm the worm, and it's plain to see 
That we were meant to be

We were meant to be
We were meant to be
If you're the bird, if you're the bird then I'm the worm
We were meant to be"
Taylor Swift,Teardrops On My Guitar,"Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing, everything that we should be
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny
That I can't even see anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes so perfectly, the kind of flawless I wish I could be
She better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

So I drive home alone
As I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down
And maybe get some sleep tonight

'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into

Hannah Montana,Every Part Of Me,"Oh-oh-oh-oh

I feel like I'm, a million miles away, from myself
More and more these days
I've been down, so many open roads
But they never lead me home
And now I just don't know
Who I really am, how it's gonna be
Is there something that I can't see?
I wanna understand

Maybe I will never be, who I was before
Maybe I don't even know her anymore
Or maybe who I am today, ain't so far from yesterday
Can I find a way to be
Every part of me

So I'll try, try to slow things down, and find myself, 
Get my feet back on the ground
It'll take time, but I know I'll be all right
Cause nothing much has changed on the inside
It's hard to figure out, how it's gonna be
'Cause I don't really know now
I wanna understand

Maybe I will never be, who I was before
Maybe I don't even know her anymore
Or maybe who I am today, ain't so far from yesterday
Can I find a way to be
Every part of me, yeah

I don't wanna wait too long
To find out where I'm meant to belong
I've always wanted to be where I am today
But I never thought I'd feel this way

Maybe I will never be, who I was before
Maybe I don't even know her anymore
Or maybe who I am today, ain't so far from yesterday
Can I find a way to be
Every part of me

Hannah Montana,I Wanna Know You,"When I saw you over there, I didn't mean to stare
But my mind was everywhere I wanna know you

But you listen when I have something to show you
There's a mark above your eye, you got it in July
Fighting for your sister's reputation
You remember people's names, and valentines are lame
So I bring you flowers just for no occasion, oh

I wanna know you
I wanna go there where you go
I wanna find out what you know
And maybe someday down the road
Sit back and say to myself, ""Yeah, I thought so.""

You smile, never shout
You stand out in a crowd
You make the best of every situation
Correct me if I'm wrong
You're fragile and you're strong
A beautiful and perfect combination

I wanna know you
I wanna go there where you go
I wanna find out what you know
And maybe someday down the road
Sit back and say to myself
I like how you are with me, in our future history
And maybe someday down the road
I'll sit back and say to myself, ""Yeah, I thought so.""

Yeah, I thought so, whoa, yeah, yeah

I wanna know you
I wanna go there where you go
I wanna find out what you know
And maybe someday down the road
Sit back and say to myself
I like how you are with me, in our future history
And maybe someday down the road
I'll sit back and say to myself, ""Yeah, I thought so."""
Hannah Montana,He Could Be the One,"Smooth talking, so rockin'
He's got everything that a girl's wanting
Guitar cutie, he plays it groovy
And I can't keep myself from doing something stupid
Think I'm really falling for his smile
Get butterflies when he says my name

He's got something special, he's got something special
And when he's looking at me, I wanna get all sentimental
He's got something special, he's got something special
I can hardly breathe, something's telling me, 
Telling me maybe he could be the one
He could be the one, he could be the one
He could be the one, he could be the one, he could be the one

He's lightning, sparks are flying
Everywhere I go he's always on my mind and
I'm going crazy about him lately
And I can't help myself from how my heart is racing
Think I'm really digging on his vibe
He really blows me away (Hey!)

He's got something special, he's got something special
And when he's looking at me, I wanna get all sentimental
He's got something special, he's got something special
I can hardly breathe, something's telling me, 
Telling me maybe he could be the one
He could be the one, he could be the one
He could be the one, he could be the one, he could be the one

And he's got a way of making me feel
Like everything I do is
Perfectly fine
The stars are aligned when I'm with him
And I'm so into him

He's got something special, he's got something special
And when he's looking at me, I wanna get all sentimental
He's got something special, he's got something special
I can hardly breathe, something's telling me,

Just let it flow, let it take me
Where it wants to go
'Til you opened the door
There's so much more
I'd never seen it before
I was trying to fly, but I couldn't find wings
Then you came along and you changed everything

You lift my feet off the ground, spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier

I watched from a distance as you
Made life your own, every sky was
Your own kind of blue
And I wanted to know
How that would feel and you made it so real
You showed me something that I couldn't see
You opened my eyes and you made me believe

You lift my feet off the ground, spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier

Baby, you showed me what living is for
I don't want to hide anymore

I'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listenin' to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story
Like I do

But she wears short skirts, I wear t-shirts
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreamin' 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see
You belong with me?
You belong with me

Walkin' the streets with you and your worn out jeans
I can't help thinkin' this is how it ought to be
Laughin' on a park bench, thinkin' to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?

And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, what ya doin' with a girl like that?

She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreamin' 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're lookin' for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you
See
You belong with me?

Standin' by you, waitin' at your back door
All this time, how could you not know
Baby, you belong with me
You belong with me

Oh I remember you, drivin' to my house in the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh, when you know you're 'bout to cry
I know your favorite songs, and you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong, think I know it's with me

Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you?
Been here all along, so why can't you
See
You belong with me?

Standin' by you, waitin' at your back door
All this time, how could you not know
Baby
You belong with me, you belong with me

You belong with me, have you ever thought, just maybe
You belong with me, you belong with me"
Taylor Swift,Love Story,"We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello.""
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwin' pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet!""
And I was cryin' on the staircase
Beggin' you, ""Please don't go!"" 
And I said...

""Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say yes.""

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while
Oh, oh

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet!""
But you were everything to me
I was beggin' you, ""Please don't go!"" 
And I said...

""Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say yes.

Romeo, save me, they try to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's a real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say yes.""

Oh, oh

But I got tired of waiting
Wonderin' if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town 
And I said...

""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think.""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said...

""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say...yes!""

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

'Cause we were both young when I first saw you!"
Taylor Swift,Safe & Sound - from The Hunger Games Soundtrack,"I remember tears streaming down your face
When I said, ""I'll never let you go""
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said, ""Don't leave me here alone""
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight

Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be all right
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

Don't you dare look out your window
Darling, everything's on fire
The war outside our door keeps raging on
Hold on to this lullaby
Even when the music's gone, gone

Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be all right
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

Let you know that you're always welcome so that you never leave, oh
Buy you all those fancy things that you only see on TV, yeah
Run away to a hideaway, we be living the American Dream

And I know it's never gonna be that easy
But I know that it won't hurt us to try, oh.

If I could take away the pain
And put a smile on your face,
Baby, I would, baby, I would.
If I could make a better way,
So you could see a better day,
Baby, I would, baby, I would.

Wo-oh, wo-oh, wo-oh, baby, I would

I would build the love of river wide,
So that it never runs dry, yeah
Anytime you ask me why I'm smiling, say that I'm satisfied
You got your flaws and so do I, past lovers that made you cry⬧
And though I wanna make it right
I just can't read your mind, no.

And I know it's never gonna be that easy
But I know that it won't hurt us to try

If I could take away the pain
And put a smile on your face,
Baby, I would, baby, I would.
If I could make a better way,
So you could see a better day,
Baby, I would, baby, I would.

Wo-oh, wo-oh, wo-oh, baby, I would

Yeah, it's not about what I want
It's all about what you need.
I know that he hurt you,
But that wasn't me
And I know, and I know sometimes it's hard to see
That all we need to be

If I could take away the pain
And put a smile on your face,
Baby, I would, baby, I would
If I could make a better way,
So you could see a better day, no,
Baby, I would, baby, I would,

Wo-oh, wo-oh, wo-oh, baby, I would."

Justin Bieber,I'll Show You,"My life is a movie
And everyone’s watching
So let’s get to the good part
And passed all the non-sense

Sometimes it’s hard to do the right thing
When the pressures is coming down like lightening
It’s like they want me to be perfect
When they don’t even know that I’m hurting
'Cause life’s not easy
I’m not made out of steel
Don’t forget that I’m human, don’t forget that I’m real
Act like you know me, but you never will
There’s one thing I know for sure

I’ll show you
I’ll show you
I’ll show you
I'll show you

I’ve got to learn things
Learn them the hard way
Got to see what it feels like
No matter what they say

When the pressures is coming down like lightening
It’s like they want me to be perfect
When they don’t even know that I’m hurting

You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call the referee?
'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness

I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
And by once or twice I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight

You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't

And I didn't wanna write a song 'cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

And I didn't wanna write a song 'cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
Had never felt so low when I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'

Be each other's paradise
Need a picture for my frame
Someone to share my ring
Tell me what you wanna drink
I tell you what I got in mind
Oh I don't know your name
But I feel like that's gonna change

You ain't gotta be my lover for you to call me baby
Never been around no press, ain't that serious

Can we, we keep, keep each other company
Maybe we, can be, be each other's company
Oh company

It ain't about the complications
I'm all about the elevation
We can keep it goin' up
Oh, don't miss out on us
Just wanna have a conversation
Forget about the obligations
Maybe we can stay in touch
Oh that ain't doin' too much

Justin Bieber,No Pressure,"You ain't gotta answer none of my calls.
I'm believing you'll pick up one day.
I don't wanna add to your pain at all.
I'm praying that time makes a change in your life.
I'm realizing how much you made a change in my life.
And I don't wanna spend it with nobody else.
Hear me? Don't nobody deserve myself.
Oh no, baby what I'm saying is.

You ain't gotta make your mind up.
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now.
Right now, don't rush, no pressure.
You ain't gotta make your mind up.
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now.
Calm down, don't rush, no pressure.

Thought that you were in it for the paper.
Never thought I'd take you serious.
Now I need you, not a moment later.
Losin' it, I'm so delirious.
And I'ma put up a fight for it.
Never give up a love like this.
Finally I found someone.
That can do me like no other.
Talking to my conscience.
I made a few mistakes.
I did it to myself.
I'm the only one to blame.
I know you need a little while to believe again.
To love again.

You ain't gotta make your mind up.

Put my key in the ignition.
Don't rush it girl, just stretch it out for me.
I know that you ain't got no plans to leave.
Girl I need your attention.
And every time I see you make that face.
I wanna love you all over the place.
Don't do it, baby.
Don't do it to me, no.

I know you don't wanna talk, right.
We've been on and off like the crosslights.
You heard I'm playin' with them hoes like I golf, right?
When I touch you, I get frostbite.
Girl you're so cold, so cold, so cold.
How we so young but livin' so old?
In the bed together but we sleepin' solo.
That could drive you loco.
You supposed to me my uno, Yoko Ono.
Oh no, round two again.
We've been fighting more than Ryu and Ken
Last time we argued eight straight days.
I learned my lesson, I got straight As.
And I know it's deeper than masseuses.
Oh, you know I eat the cookie like I'm Lucious
Go ahead and take the time.
But it's a waste of time if your waist ain't on mine.
Think about it.

You ain't gotta make your mind up.
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now.
Right now, don't rush, no pressure.
You ain't gotta make your mind up.
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now.
I'll be waiting for you.

Justin Bieber,No Sense,"It don't make no sense 'less I'm doing it with you
It don't make no sense 'less I'm doing it with you

The sun don't set the same
'Less you're watching it go down with me
The bed won't sleep the same
'Less you're waking up in here with me
Oh, my heart's a vacant house
When you're gone away, it's so empty
And love don't make no sense when it's empty (Oh no)

I've driven almost every car
It ain't the same when I'm without you
Been around a million stars
None of them shine brighter than you
The sky be so dark now without you
Yeah, ooh, baby

It don't make no sense

It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you

Focus ain't the same
If the picture ain't got you in it
In every line my
Emotions ain't the same
If it ain't about you, I don't get it
Ever since the beginning now
You had that effect on me
All I wanna do is you, oh
I mean that so literally
Don't nobody go harder than you
All of the angels must be lonely now, without you, whoa

Time and time again I break a plan
Without you, girl I ain't the man
Could never be all I can be
You overstand, I'm incomplete
Apparently, gotta know I hate that
How I'm supposed to take that?
Boo'd up, missing all of that
Gotta be laying in that
Rolled up, put a flame to that
Thought by now you would have made it back
Be patient
Won't you pull up to me now?
Live forever young
It's amazing
I don't want to sleep 'less you at home

Justin Bieber,The Feeling,"You are to me
A part of me just like anatomy
You're pulling me
You're pulling me in like you're gravity

I'm notorious for thinking you're full of beautiful
Instead of hollow
Sugar on your lips, it's hard to kill
Jagged like a pill, so hard to swallow

Am I in love with you? Am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
Trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth
Sometimes the heart is deceiving
Can't get out of my head, I need you to save me
If I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy
In love with you, am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?

You give to me
Everything, anything that I could dream
And at least that's what it seems
Could it be I don't know what's good for me?

I'm notorious for thinking you're full of beautiful
Instead of hollow
Sugar on your lips, it's hard to kill
Jagged like a pill, so hard to swallow

Am I in love with you? Am I in love with you?

I'm sinking faster and faster
Between heaven and disaster
Sorry if I made you feel like
I'm standing on the borderline

Am I in love with you? Am I in love with you?

Justin Bieber,Life Is Worth Living,"Ended up on a crossroad
Try to figure out which way to go
It's like you're stuck on a treadmill
Running in the same place
You got your hazard lights on now
Hoping that somebody would slow down
Praying for a miracle
Who'll show you grace?
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas
With a long journey ahead
Seen a truck pull over
God sent an angel to help you out
He gave you direction
Showed you how to read a map
With a long journey ahead
Said it ain't over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again

Relationship on a ski slope
Avalanche comin' down slow
Do we have enough time to salvage this love?
Feels like a blizzard in April
'Cause my heart is just that cold
Skating on thin ice
But it's strong enough to hold us up
Seen her scream and holler
Put us both on blast
Tearing each other down
When I thought it was over
God sent us an angel to help us out
He gave us direction, showed us how to make it last
For that long journey ahead
Said it ain't ever over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again
Life is worth living again

What I'd give for my affection
Is a different perception
From what the world may see
They try to crucify me
I ain't perfect, won't deny
My reputation's on the line
So I'm working on a better me

Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes
Only God can judge me
Life is worth living again
Another day
Life is worth living again"

Justin Bieber,Purpose,"Feeling like I'm breathing my last breath
Feeling like I'm walking my last steps
Look at all of these tears I've wept
Look at all the promises that I've kept

I put my heart into your hands
Here's my soul to keep
I let you in with all that I can
You're not hard to reach
And you bless me with the best gift
That I've ever known
You give me purpose
Yeah, you've given me purpose

Thinking my journey's come to an end
Sending out a farewell to my friends, forever peace
Ask you to forgive me for my sins, oh would you please?
I'm more than grateful for the time we spent, my spirit's at ease

I put my heart into your hands
Learn the lessons you teach
No matter what, wherever I am
You're not hard to reach
And you've given me the best gift
That I've ever known
You give me purpose everyday
You give me purpose in every way

Oh, you are my everything
Oh, you are my everything

I don't know if this is wrong because someone else is telling me that it's wrong but I feel this so let me just like, try my best not to let this happen again. We weren't necessarily put in the best position to make the best decisions.

You can't be hard on yourself for these were the cards that you were given so you have to understand that these, like... that's not who you are. You're trying to be the best you can be but that's all you can do. If you don't give it all you got, you're only cheating yourself. Give it all you got, but if it ends up happening, it ends up happening.

That's what it's... that's what's happening with me. It's like God I'm giving it all I got, sometimes I'm weak and I'm gonna do it, and it's like I'm not giving myself grace, I'm just like understanding, that's just how it is."
Justin Bieber,Been You,"Feeling the remnants, got it in an instance
Blink of an eye, no goodbye
I had a notion deep as the ocean

Like a permanent stain 
Wishing I could just wash away, away

Who was to blame for all the pain? For all the pain?

If I would've known, if I would've known
If I would have known it could have been you
If I had the chance, if I had the chance I'd make us brand new
I never wanted to be, wanted to be your remnants
No, but if I, if I would've known
If I would have known it could have been you, been you

There are percussions, I'm missing your loving
Must be the night, the ghost of a life
All of the memories
A serenity dwindling my mind
All the time

Like a permanent stain 
Wishing I could just wash away, away
Prayed our love wasn't vain
Who was to blame for all the pain? For all the pain?

Hurts but it's necessary.
Don't want us to lose what we are
Don't want us to lose what we are.
Lose what we are.

If it ain't broke then we don't need to fix it.
Believing in what she say'll have you livid.
Know they won't be happy till our love is over.
They tryna break us up but you don't wanna get it.

They ain't ever had trust like how we got it.
They ain't never had a chance how you got it.
So they can't help but to come and hate on it.
They see what we got and you know they want it, don't question it.

Lose what we are.

It's like you're always looking for a problem.
The raining of equations for you to solve 'em.
So quick to turn nothin' right into somethin'.
Get the numbers out my phone, go 'head and call 'em.

They ain't ever had trust like how we got it.
They ain't never had a chance how you got it.
So they can't help but to come and hate on it.

She texts me ""How's you love life?"" and ""How are you?"", I said ""I'm good"".
They only get as close as you allow them to.
We should be closer together, warm oceans, better weather.
Instead of us playing games forever, she says whatever.
I says whatever, who get you wetter than a half moon wearer.
HSTRY sweater, serendipity when you with me.
Swear you love that one thing we did that one time in that one place.
Blew your mind, you got my mind going when I'm home.
I'm serious girl, a much older dude, a whole 42.
I've accomplished my goals, it's only you.
You and I in that Wraith, retire my pimp super-fly cape.
Just my Mets cap and my badge and I'm straight.
Esco.

You ain't gotta question it.
You already know the answer.
The truth don't make us relevant.
Hurts but it's necessary.
Don't want us to lose what we are.
Don't want us to lose what we are.
Lose what we are."
Justin Bieber,Trust,"Oh oh baby
Yeah, oh oh

If I believe in love and you believe in love
Then we can be in love somehow
If you want the best for us
Like I want the best for us
Then we gotta learn to trust right now

Don't let this effort go to waste
Put our all in it
Don't want to be left with the questions, why
Let's be honest with ourselves
Did we really come this far
Just to watch it go down the drain?

Yeah, sometimes the heart what's invisible to the eye
All you gotta do is listen to your deepest feelings
They don't ever lie
Well giving up is immature
There's so much more to live for
That I want to see us together now
'Cause we're strong enough to endure, whoa

If I believe in love and you believe in love
Then we can be in love, somehow
If you want the best for us
Like I want the best for us
Then we got to learn to trust right now

Growing pains come along with these changes
Some people get closer some people separate, yeah
Don't think we should separate
And we both adore one another
You're a dream come true
We should start off brand new
That's what we ought to do
Yeah

Yeah, sometimes the heart what's invisible to the eye
All you gotta do is listen to your deepest feelings
They don't ever lie
Well giving up is immature
There's so much more to live for
That I want to see us together now
'Cause we're strong enough to endure, whoa

If I believe in love and you believe in love
Then we can be in love somehow
If you want the best for us
Like I want the best for us
Then we gotta learn to trust right now

Trust me right now
Yeah, yeah, yeah-ah-ah-ah
Oh, we gotta learn to trust right now
Yeah, yeah, yeah-ah-ah-ah
Girl you gotta learn to trust me right now
Hey, hey, yeah
If I believe in love and you believe in love
Then we can be in love somehow
If you want the best for us
I got the best for us
We gotta learn to trust
We gotta learn to trust
Yeah, whoa whoa"
Justin Bieber,All In It,"Don't do nothin' 'less your heart's in it
Heart's in it, heart's in it
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it

If you got a twenty for all of your tries
Twenty for all of the times, the times you got back up, whoa
You'd be a billionaire in a year
That's what you gotta think till you're there, on the record line

If you got a diamond for all of your passion, diamond for your dedication
You could be icy like cake and icy for every occasion, gotta go hard, yeah
Still don't condone it, love is a component
You're the only opponent, gotta seize the moment

And don't do nothin' 'less your heart's in it
Heart's in it, heart's in it
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it
Gonna give me time
Said I won't hurt my side
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it

All in it, all in it

Baby, I had a good time, and yes I pop strings
A guitar with only one string, I can only play one song, ooh
A simple melody, simple enough to make the world sing
Strong enough to make your mood swing, you know what I mean

If you got a diamond for all of your passion, diamond for your dedication
You could be icy like cake and icy for every occasion, gotta go hard, yeah
Still don't condone it, love is a component
You're the only opponent, gotta seize the moment

And don't do nothin' 'less your heart's in it
Heart's in it, heart's in it
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it
Gonna give me time
Said I won't hurt my side
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it

All in it, all in it

She growing up aight
I always felt like I had to be the best at everything
Because I, I just didn't think I wasn't good enough
And maybe if I was good at something, that I'd get recognition from that
But I quickly found out that
I wasn't going to get the recognition that I wanted or that I needed
Because, because people aren't perfect
And, by not being perfect you, you sometimes can disappoint people
And with God, it's like he's perfect and he never disappoints
So I just get my recognition from him
And give him recognition"
Ed Sheeran,Shape of You,"The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow

You come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put van the man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance
And now I'm singing like

Girl you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me

Say boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now follow my lead
Come, come on now follow my lead

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body

Last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
Well I'm in love with your body

(Oh I, oh I, oh I, oh I)
I'm in love with your body
(Oh I, oh I, oh I, oh I)
I'm in love with your body
(Oh I, oh I, oh I, oh I)
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate

We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play
And I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me

Say boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me

Had another talk about where it's going wrong
But we're still young
We don't know where we're going
But we know where we belong

No, we started
Two hearts in one home
It's hard when we argue
We're both stubborn
I know but oh

Sweet creature, sweet creature
Wherever I go, you bring me home
Sweet creature, sweet creature
When I run out of rope, you bring me home

Sweet creature
We're running through the garden
Where nothing bothered us
But we're still young
I always think about you and how we don't speak enough

No, we started
Two hearts in one home
It's hard when we argue
We're both stubborn
I know but oh

Sweet creature, sweet creature
Wherever I go, you bring me home
Sweet creature, sweet creature
When I run out of rope, you bring me home

I know when we started
Two hearts in one home

R. Kelly,I Believe I Can Fly,"I used to think that I could not go on
And life was nothing but an distrustful song
But now I know the meaning of true love
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms
If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

See I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me
If I can see it, then I can be it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

Hey, 'cause I believe in you
Oh

If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

If I just spread my wings (I can fly)
I can fly (I can fly)
I can fly (I can fly)
I can fly (I can fly)
If I just spread my wings (I can fly)
I can fly...(I can fly,i can fly)
Woo... I can fly

Harry Styles,Sign of the Times,"Just stop your crying
It's a sign of the times
Welcome to the final show
Hope you're wearing your best clothes
You can't bribe the door on your way to the sky
You look pretty good down here
But you ain't really good

If we never learn, we been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets?
The bullets
We never learn, we been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets?
The bullets

Just stop your crying
It's a sign of the times
We gotta get away from here
We gotta get away from here
Just stop your crying
It will be all right
They told me that the end is near
We gotta get away from here

Just stop crying
Have the time of your life
Breaking through the atmosphere
And things are pretty good from here
Remember everything will be all right
We can meet again somewhere
Somewhere far away from here

If we never learn, we been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets?

We never learn, we been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from

We should open up
Before it's all too much
Will we ever learn?

It's just what we know

Michael Jackson,Billie Jean,"She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round

She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And Mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Do think twice, do think twice)

She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no!)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby

People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
Just the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son

She says I am the one
(You know what you did
(She says he is my son
Breaking my heart babe)
She says I am the one

Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
(Don't Billie Jean)
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover"

Feel the same way too

Said I promise to never

When you smile my face glows
You picked me up when I was down

You're all that I ever know
When you smile my face glows
You picked me up when I was down

Feel the same way too
Yes I pray that you
Do love me too

Shayne Ward,I Cry,"You said goodbye
I fell apart
I fell from all we had
To I never knew
I needed you so bad

You need to let things go
I know, you told me so
I've been through hell
To break the spell

Why did I ever let you slip away
Can't stand another day without you
Without the feeling
I once knew

I cry silently
I cry inside of me
I cry hopelessly
'Cause I know I'll never breathe your love again
I cry
'Cause you're not here with me
I cry
'Cause I'm lonely as can be
I cry hopelessly
'Cause I know I'll never breathe your love again

If you could see me now
You would know just how
How hard I try
Not to wonder why

I wish I could believe in something new
Oh please somebody tell me it's not true (oh girl)
I'll never be over you

Why did I ever let you slip away
Can't stand another day without you
Without the feeling
I once knew

I cry silently
I cry inside of me
I cry hopelessly
'Cause I know I'll never breathe your love again
I cry
'Cause you're not here with me
I cry
'Cause I'm lonely as can be
I cry hopelessly
'Cause I know I'll never breathe your love again

If I could have you back tomorrow
If I could lose the pain and sorrow
I would do just anything
To make you see
You still love me

I cry inside of me
I cry hopelessly

'Cause you're not here with me

You have to show them that you're really not scared
You're playing with your life, this ain't no truth or dare
They'll kick you, then they beat you, then they'll tell you it's fair
So beat it, but you wanna be bad

She came along

Push aside
What use to be

I'm giving up on you
I don't need you anymore

So hear my emptyness
I've got no room for you
I've finally found what I've been dreamin' of
Someone to love

Hey
'Cause I was lost
I was down and out
Until that day
I knew what my life was all about
Still wonder how
She came my way
She's the reason I'm smiling here today

So hear my loneliness
I'm giving up on you
I don't need you anymore
I've found what I been lookin' for
So hear my emptyness
I've got no room for you
I've finally found what I've been dreamin' of

Someone to love
To hold
To be my inspiration
Someone to touch, to cherise for life

So hear my loneliness
I'm giving up on you
I don't need you anymore
I've found what I been lookin' for
So hear my emptyness
I've got no room for you
I've finally found what I've been dreamin' of

'Cause it's in and out my life, driving me, baby
'Cause baby, love never felt so good

Never felt so good, oh

Never felt so... no

Backstreet Boys,Show Me the Meaning of Being Lonely,"Show me the meaning of being lonely

So many words for the broken heart
It's hard to see in a crimson love
So hard to believe
Walk with me and maybe
Nights of light so soon become
Wild and free, I can feel the sun
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart

Life goes on as it never ends
Eyes of stone observe the trends
They never say, forever gaze, if only
Guilty roads to an endless love (Endless love)
There's no control, are you with me now?
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with? (Tell me why)
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart

There's nowhere to run, I have no place to go
Surrender my heart, body, and soul
How can it be you're asking me to feel things you never show?

You are missing in my heart
Tell me why I cannot be there where you are?

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with? (Tell me why)
Tell me why I can't be there where you are (Where you are)
There's something missing in my heart (You are missing in my heart)

Show me the meaning of being lonely (Being lonely)
Is this the feeling I need to walk with? (Tell me why)
Tell me why I can't be there where you are (Can't be there where you are)
There's something missing in my heart"
Flo Rida,Wild Ones (feat. Sia),"(Sia)
Hey I heard you were a wild one, ooh
If I took you home, it'd be a home run
Show me how you'll do
I want to shut down the club with you
Hey I heard you like the wild ones, ooh

(Flo Rida)
I like crazy, foolish, stupid
Party going wild, fist pumping music,
I might lose it
Blast through the roof,
That's how we do's it, do's it, do's it

I don't care tonight, she don't care
We like almost there, the right vibe
Ready to get live, ain't no surprise
Take me so high, jumping those dives
Surfin' the crowd

Ooh ooh
Said I gotta be the man, I'm the head of my fam,
Mike check, one two, ooh
Shut them down in the club when the Playboy does,

And they all get loose, loose
Out the bottle, we all get bent and again tomorrow
Gotta break rules 'cause that's the motto
Club shut down, a hundred supermodels

(Sia)
Hey I heard you were a wild one, ooh
If I took you home, it'd be a home run
Show me how you'll do
I want to shut down the club with you
Hey I heard you like the wild ones, ooh

(Flo Rida)
Party rocker, fo' sho' stopper
More shampoo
Number one club popper
Got a hangover like too much vodka
Can't see me with ten binoculars

So cool
No doubt by the end of the night
Got the clothes coming off
Then I make that move
Somehow, someway, gotta raise the roof, roof
All black shades when the sun come through

Oh, it's on like everything goes
Riled up baby to the freaky show
What happens to that body is a private show
Stays right here, pri-private show

I like 'em untamed, don't tell me 'bout pain
Tell 'em this, bottoms up with the champagne
My life, coming harder than we hit play
Do you busy with the bail, were you insane?

(Sia)
Hey I heard you were a wild one, ooh
If I took you home, it'd be a home run
Show me how you'll do
I want to shut down the club with you
Hey I heard you like the wild ones, ooh

I am a wild one, break me in
Saddle me up and let's begin
I am a wild one, tame me now
Running with wolves, and I'm on the prowl

(Flo Rida)
I show you another side of me
A side you would never thought you'd see
Tear up that body, dominate you, till you had enough
I heard you like the wilds, don't lie

(Sia)
Hey I heard you were a wild one, ooh
If I took you home, it'd be a home run
Show me how you'll do
I want to shut down the club with you
Hey I heard you like the wild ones, ooh

I am a wild one, break me in
Saddle me up and let's begin
I am a wild one, tame me now

Miley Cyrus,Malibu,"I never came to the beach, or stood by the ocean
I never sat by the shore, under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free as birds catching the wind
I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand

But here I am, next to you
The skies so blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you

We watched the sun go down as we were walking
I'd spent the rest of my life standing here talking
You would explain the current, as I try to smile
Hoping I just stay the same, and nothing will change
And it'll be us, just for a while
Do we even exist?
That's when I make the wish, to swim away with the fish
Is it supposed to be this hot all summer long?
I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song

But here I am, next to you
The skies so blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you
Next to you
The skies so blue in Malibu
Next to you

We are just like the waves that flow back and forth
Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning
And you're there to save me
And I wanna thank you with all of my heart
It's a brand new start
A dream come true in Malibu"
Shayne Ward,You're Not Alone,"She's getting out of bed
At half past ten
She starts to comb her hair
Just an ordinary day 
She looks at her reflection
Off the wall
Why do I care at all
Just an ordinary day
An ordinary day
That's hurting you
Don't hide out inside yourself
If you only let the sunshine on you
I promise you
You're not alone
When the lights go out at night
When you're feeling lost inside
You're not alone
You're not alone
When your world is falling down
I will be the one around
You're not alone
You're not alone
She's waiting for the bus it's 12.59
She's sitting on her own
Just an ordinary day
She's looking at the people 
Passing her by
It could be you and I
They would never dream
Of slowing down
To see if she's alright 
Don't hide out inside yourself
If you only let the sunshine on you
I promise you
You're not alone
When the lights go out at night
When you're feeling lost inside
You're not alone
You're not alone
When your world is falling down
I will be the one around
You're not alone

I'm hurting, she's hurting
I'm so alone
When the lights go out at night
When you're feeling lost inside
You're not alone
I will be the one around"

Shayne Ward,Back At One,"It's undeniable
That we should be together

That I'm for real
If all things in time
Time will reveal

Two, just wanna be with you
Three, girl it's plain to see
That you're the only one for me
Four, repeat steps one through three
Five, make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done
Then I start back at one

So incredible
The way things work themselves out
And all emotional, once you know what it's all about babe
And undesirable
For us to be apart

Say farewell to the dark night
I see the coming of the sun
I feel like a little child
Whose life has just begun
You came and breathed new life
Into this lonely heart of mine
You threw out the life line
Just in the nick of time

One, you're like a dream come true
Two, just wanna be with you
Three, girl it's plain to see
That you're the only one for me
Four, repeat steps one through three

Waiting half the day

Knocked to the ground
But he gets to his feet and he says...

What about me
It isn't fair
I've had enough now I want my share
Can't you see
I wanna live
But you just take more then you give

There's a pretty girl standing at the counter of the corner shop

She's been waitin' back there
Waitin' for her dreams
Her dreams walk in and I begged 'em to stop
Well she's not too proud
To cry out loud
She runs to the street and she screams:

What about me
It isn't fair
I've had enough now I wasn't my share
Can't you see
I wanna live
But you just take more then you give

So take a step back and see the little people
They may be young
But they're the ones who need to be people be
So listen
As they whisper
What about me

Now I'm standing on the corner all the world's gone home
Nobody's changed
Nobody's been saved
And I'm feeling cold and alone
I guess I'm lucky
I start a lot
But sometimes I wish to gooooooooooooo
Here I cooooooome...

It flickers, flickers
Who cares when someone's time runs out
If a moment is all we are
We're quicker, quicker
Who cares if one more light goes out?
Well I do

The reminders, pull the floor from your feet
In the kitchen, one more chair than you need, oh
And you're angry, and you should be, it's not fair
Just 'cause you can't see it, doesn't mean it isn't there

You tell me it's alright
Tell me I'm forgiven, tonight
But nobody can save me now
I'm holding up a light
Chasing up the darkness inside
'Cause nobody can save me

Stared into this illusion
For answers yet to come
I chose a false solution
But nobody proved me wrong

Watch the ground giving way now

Linkin Park,Halfway Right,"I scream at myself when there's nobody else to fight
I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, then I'm halfway right

Used to get high with the dead end kids
Abandoned houses where the shadows live
I never been higher than I was that night
I woke up driving my car
I couldn't see then what I see right now
The road dissolving like an empty vow
Couldn't remember where I'd been that night
I knew I took it too far

All you said to do was slow down
I remember, now I remember
All you said to do was slow down
But I was already gone

I scream at myself when there's nobody else to fight
I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, then I'm halfway right
I know what I want, but it feels like I'm paralyzed
I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, then I'm halfway right (halfway right)

Told me ""Kid, you're going way to fast
You burn too bright, you know you'll never last""
It was bullshit then, I guess it makes sense now
I woke up driving my car
Said I'd lose you if I lost control
I just laughed because what do they know?
Here I am, standing all alone
Because I took it too far

All you said to do was slow down
I remember, now I remember
All you said to do was slow down
But I was already gone

I scream at myself when there's nobody else to fight
I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, then I'm halfway right

Linkin Park,Battle Symphony,"I got a long way to go
And a long memory
I been searching for an answer
Always just out of reach
Blood on the floor
Sirens repeat
I been searching for the courage
To face my enemies

When they turn down the lights
I hear my battle symphony
All the world in front of me
If my armor breaks
I'll fuse it back together
Battle symphony
Please just don't give up on me
And my eyes are wide awake

For my battle symphony
For my battle symphony

They say that I don't belong
Say that I should retreat
That I'm marching to the rhythm
Of a lonesome defeat
But the sound of your voice
Puts the pain in reverse
No surrender, no illusions
And for better or worse

When they turn down the lights
I hear my battle symphony
All the world in front of me
If my armor breaks
I'll fuse it back together
Battle symphony
Please just don't give up on me
And my eyes are wide awake

If I fall, get knocked down
Pick myself up off the ground
If I fall, get knocked down
Pick myself up off the ground

When they turn down the lights
I hear my battle symphony
All the world in front of me
If my armor breaks
I'll fuse it back together
Battle symphony
Please just don't give up on me
And my eyes are wide awake
For my battle symphony
For my battle symphony"

Echoes and buzzing noises
I know the words we said
But wish I could've turned our voices down

Only organized confusion
I'm just trying to get it right
And in spite of all I should've done

I was not mad at you
I was not trying to tear you down
The words that I could've used
I was too scared to say out loud
If I cannot break your fall
I'll pick you up right off the ground
If you felt invisible, I won't let you feel that now

Linkin Park,Good Goodbye (feat. Pusha T and Stormzy),"So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)

Live from the rhythm, it's
Something wild, venomous
Enemies trying to read me
You're all looking highly illiterate
Blindly forgetting if I'm in the mix
You won't find an equivalent
I've been here killing it
Longer than you've been alive, you idiot
And it makes you so mad
Somebody else could be stepping in front of you
And it makes you so mad that you're not the only one
There's more than one of you
And you can't understand the fact
That it's over and done, hope you had fun
You've got a lot to discuss on the bus
Headed back where you're from

So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
Good goodbye

Pusha T:
Goodbye, good riddance
A period is after every sentence
Did my time with my cellmate
Maxed out so now we finished
Every day was like a hail date
Every night was like a hailstorm
Took her back to my tinted windows
Showin' out, she in rare form
Wings up, now I'm airborne
King Push, they got a chair for him
Make way for the new queen
The old lineup, where they cheer for 'em
Consequence when you ain't there for him
Were you there for him?
Did you care for him?
You were dead wrong

(Don't you come back no more)
So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)

Stormzy:
Yo
Let me say goodbye to my demons
Let me say goodbye to my past life
Let me say goodbye to the darkness
Tell 'em that I'd rather be here in the starlight
Tell 'em that I'd rather be here where they love me
Tell 'em that I'm yours, this is our life
And I still keep raising the bar like
Never seen a young black brother in the chart twice
Goodbye to the stereotypes
You can't tell my kings we can't
Mandem we're linking tings in parks
Now I gotta tune with Linkin Park
Like goodbye to my old hoes
Goodbye to the cold roads
I can't die for my postcode
Young little Mike from the Gold Coast
And now I'm inside with my bro bros
Gang

So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)
Good goodbye
Good goodbye

Linkin Park,Sorry for Now,"Watching the wings cut through the clouds
Watching the raindrops blinking red and white
Thinking of you back on the ground
There with a fire burning in your eyes
I only halfway apologized

And I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
Sometimes things refuse
To go the way we planned
Oh I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
There will be a day
That you will understand
You will understand

After a while you may forget
But just in case the memories cross your mind
You couldn't know this when I left
Under the fire of your angry eyes
I never wanted to say goodbye

So I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
Sometimes things refuse
To go the way we planned
Oh I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
There will be a day
That you will understand
You will understand

Yeah, stop telling 'em to pump the bass up
Tried to call home but nobody could wait up
Switch your time zones can't pick the pace up
I just passed out by the time you wake up
Best things come to those who wait
And it's bound to get rough on any road you take
But don't you ever have a doubt and make no mistake
I can't wait to come back when I'm going away

So I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
There are things we have to do that we can't stand
Oh I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
There will be a day that you will understand
Oh I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
There are things we have to do that we can't stand
(Things we have to do that we can't stand)
Oh I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around

Imagine Dragons,Whatever It Takes,"Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling is vulturous
Negative, Nepotist

Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

Whip, whip
Run me like a race horse
Hold me like a rip cord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains

Whatever it takes
You take me to the top, I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging onto the visual
I wanna be invisible

Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough from the particle sum
I was born to run, I was born for this

Whip, whip
Run me like a race horse
Hold me like a rip cord
Break me down and build me up

Whatever it takes
You take me to the top, I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical
Hypothetical, working onto something that I'm proud of
Out of the box an epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost

I'm an apostrophe, I'm just a symbol to reminds you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece and yet I'm half diseased
And when I am deceased

At least I go down to the grave and die happily
Leave the body of my soul to be a part of me
I do what it takes

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains

Whatever it takes
Ya take me to the top, I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins

""Don't you run with scissors, son
You're gonna hurt someone""
Mama told me look before you leap
Always think before you speak, and watch the friends you keep

Stay along the beaten path, never listened when she said

Sharp edges have consequences, I
Guess that I had to find out for myself
Sharp edges have consequences, now
Every scar is a story I can tell

Should've played it safer from the start
Loved you like a house of cards
Let it fall apart
But all the things I couldn't understand
Never could've planned
They made me who I am
Put your nose on paperbacks
Instead of smoking cigarettes
These are years you're never getting back

Stay along the beaten path, never listened when she said

Sharp edges have consequences, I
Guess that I had to find out for myself
Sharp edges have consequences, now
Every scar is a story I can tell

We all fall down
We live somehow
We learn what doesn't kill us makes us stronger
We all fall down

Around until we found a place to stay and waste the day away
We'd do nothing but it was okay with me
You say it's not good to spend all my time
Thinking about you so late at night
But I can't stop once I start it's like an avalanche
Thoughts coming and I just wanna hold your hand
Hold your breath, I'm going under

They don't wanna see me

John Legend,Penthouse Floor,"All this trouble in this here town
All this shit going down
When will they focus, on this
Streets ride up with the TV crews
Look ma, we on the news
But they didn't notice
Before this
They float above the city lights
Forget the truth inhale the lies
Just enjoy the show
They see us reaching for the sky
Just ignore the (?) survive

Maybe we should go
Go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)
Go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)
Let's ride the elevator, they can't keep us out no more
Go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)
Penthouse floor

All that bubbly all that wine
Oh man look at the times
Didn't they notice, notice
Only future I can see, ain't what it used to be
And I didn't know this, I didn't know this
Once you're above the city lights
Won't want to spend another night, down there on your own
The holding on is made for us
The altitude is dangerous, but we ain't going home

Go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)
Go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)
Let's ride the elevator, it's what we've been waiting for
Can't keep us out no more (let's go, let's go, let's go)

I heard this old joke once, it was like, uh
Knock knock, who's there, it's us, us who?
Just us, who dis? Just playin'
Just me, new phone, new hair, new era
I'm in the penthouse, baby
Handpicked from bad apples and bad eggs
Held back, I had to grab crab legs
And then there were only but a few
Conversations held with patience, what a party, what a view
What a dress, what a song
What a beautiful time
My folks downstairs still waiting in line
They never been in these rooms
Never stayed with these folks
Never laughed at the news, never hated these jokes
So as I fly in my suit, in a group, undercover
Forcing a new smile, he tells me another
He said ""What happened to the boy that climbed up the trunk?""
Then he pushed me off the top and said ""Jump, nigga jump!""

Oh don't bring me down I need a room in the clouds
I wanna get there babe, I wanna elevate
Oh my favourite mix
A little ignorance and bliss
In the penthouse babe, go to the penthouse

Go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)
Go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)
Let's ride the elevator, it's what we've been waiting for
We'll tear down those penthouse doors (let's go, let's go, let's go)
Those penthouse doors
We'll tear down the penthouse doors (let's go, let's go, let's go)
Baby, I'm in the penthouse floor
Baby, let's ride the elevator
Till we can rise some more
Go to the penthouse floor, penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)"

We got the world in our hands and we're ready to play
They say we're wasted
But how can we waste it if we're loving every day?
Okay, I got the keys to the universe
So stay with me 'cause I got the keys, baby

Don't wanna wake up one day wishing that we done more

Don't wanna wake up one day wondering where'd it all go

Machine Gun Kelly,27,"And if I must go and die at 27
Then at least I know I died a legend
Now, will you roll and ride like we're together?
And keep the vibe alive inside forever
And feel me forever
They say I need to slow down, but I don't know how

Yeah
Real feelings from past dealings
When people counted me out 'til I grew up to count millions, uh
Like I guess it's good to be different, huh?
I'm a star so the sky isn't the limit, huh?
I'm living like it's my last day
Smoke as if there's not already 27 roaches in the ashtray
Smile as if no one hated at all
As if anyone understood anytime I evolved
Tell me what do you do when your dreams come true?
Buy a Bentley and look just like you?
How am I supposed to write a song when I'm famous
And all the pain is created?
I need to overdose on inspiration
27

Why don't you just go home?
Well, I can't right now, I'm a rolling stone

And if I must go, and fly away
And kiss my baby girl goodnight
And if this really is goodbye
Then let's set the city on fire
Can you take me higher?
Now, can you take me higher?
Now, can you take me higher?
Can you take me higher?

If I must go, die at 27
Then at least I know I died a legend
Will you roll and ride like we're together?
And keep the vibe alive forever
Keep the vibe alive forever
If I must go, die at 27
Then at least I know I died a legend
Will you roll and ride like we're together?
And keep the vibe alive forever
Keep the vibe alive forever

I let these words seep through my soul
And speak through the song
'Cause if one day, I'm no longer here in the physical
Then at least I give you my voice to listen to
What is a beautiful life without a beautiful death?
What is a beautiful mind, how is our beauty defined?
Is it for you to decide, is it my duty to die?
No matter how I'm remembered, just let me be remembered

Yeah, forever young, though
Always be those crazy kids running wide-eyed down the boulevard

Martin Garrix,There for You,"I woke up pissed off today
And baby, everyone feels fake
Somewhere, I lost a piece of me
Smoking cigarettes on balconies

But I can't do this alone
Sometimes I just need a light
If I call you on the phone
And you're on the other side

So when your tears roll down your pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
When you're screaming, but they only hear you whisper
I'll be loud for you
I'll be loud for you

I got you, I promise
Let me be honest
Love is a road that goes both ways
When your tears roll down your pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
But you gotta be there for me too

But you gotta be there for me too

Last year took a toll on me
But I made it with you next to me
Around the world and back again
I hope you're waiting at the end

But I can't do this alone
Sometimes I just need a light
If I call you on the phone
And you're on the other side

So when your tears roll down your pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
When you're screaming, but they only hear you whisper
I'll be loud for you
I'll be loud for you

I got you, I promise
Let me be honest
Love is a road that goes both ways
When your tears roll down your pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
But you gotta be there for me too

But you gotta be there for me too

Boy, I'm holding on to something
Won't let go of you for nothing
I'm running, running, just to keep my hands on you
There was a time that I was so blue
What I got to do to show you

Running, running, just to keep my hands on you
Running, running, just to keep my hands on you
So I'm running, running, just to keep my hands on you

Shows through your mascara lines as they stream down from your eyes

Holding them back won't turn back time

So bright they never blind me

Taylor Swift,Blank Space,"Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sins
Saw you there and I thought

""Oh my God, look at that face!""
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?

New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny, rumors fly
And I know you heard about me

So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over (mmm)
If the high was worth the pain

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless (mmm)
Or with a nasty scar

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen

Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come
Oh no

Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second-guessing like

""Oh my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over (mmm)
If the high was worth the pain

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless (oh)
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless (mmm)
Or with a nasty scar

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over (over)
If the high was worth the pain

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless

Taylor Swift,Style,"Midnight
You come and pick me up, no headlights
Long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise

Fade into view, oh
It's been a while since I have even heard from you
(Heard from you)

I should just tell you to leave 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads but I
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And then we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

You got that long hair, slick back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
We never go out of style
We never go out of style

So it goes
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road
Takes me home
Lights are off, he's taking off his coat

I say I heard, oh
That you've been out and about with some other girl
Some other girl

He says what you heard is true but I
Can't stop thinking about you and I
I said I've been there too a few times

'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And then we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

You got that long hair, slick back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt (a tight little skirt)
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style (we never go, we never go)

Take me home
Just take me home
Yeah, just take me home

And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style"
Taylor Swift,Out Of The Woods,"Looking at it now
It all seemed so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember

You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered (then discovered)
The rest of the world is black and white
But we were in screaming color

And I remember thinkin'
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?

Are we in the clear yet?

In the clear yet? Good

(Are we out of the woods?)

Looking at it now
Last December (last December)
We were built to fall apart
And fall back together (back together)

Ooh, your necklace hanging from my neck
On the night we couldn't quite forget, when we decided
We decided to move the furniture so we could dance
Baby like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying

And I remember thinkin'
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?

Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?

Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good

(Are we out of the woods?)

Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?
Twenty stitches in the hospital room
And you started crying, baby I did too
But when the sun came up, I was looking at you

Remember when we couldn't take the heat
I walked out and said I'm setting you free
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
But when the sun came up, you were looking at me

You were looking at me, oh
You were looking at me
I remember
Oh I remember

Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?

Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?

Taylor Swift,All You Had To Do Was Stay,"People like you always want back

The less I know

Off the road

Had me in the palm of your hand

Taylor Swift,I Wish You Would,"It's 2:00 AM, in your car
Windows down, you pass my street, the memories start
You say it's in the past, you drive straight ahead
You're thinking that I hate you now

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I never forget you as long as I'm livin'
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good, I wish you would

It's 2:00 AM, in my room
Headlights pass the window pane, I think of you
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
Bet it makes you turn right back around

I never forget you as long as I'm livin'

I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin
What was shining? Now it's all rusted

Did you have to hit me?
where I'm weak, baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me

It could burn out

They got the boxes and guns
They are the hunters
We are the foxes and we run

Chasing their tails tryin' to track us down

'Cause I, I know places
We can hide, I know places
I know places

Lights flash and we'll run for the fences
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time

Taylor Swift,Clean,"The drought was the very worst, ah ah
When the flowers that we'd grown
Together died of thirst
It was months and months of back and forth, ah ah
You're still all over me like
A wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore

Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turn black like a perfect storm

Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean

There was nothing left to do, ah ah
And the butterflies turned to
Dust that covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof, ah ah
Let the flood carry away
All my pictures of you

The water filled my lungs
I screamed so loud but no one heard a thing

The rain came pouring down
When I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean

I think I am finally clean, ah
Said, I think I am finally clean, ah

Ten months sober, I must admit
Just because you're clean don't mean you don't miss it
Ten months older, I won't give in
Now that I'm clean I'm never gonna risk it

The drought was the very worst, ah ah
When the flowers that we'd grown
Together died of thirst

Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning

Gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean

Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean

Finally clean
Think that I am finally clean, ah ah
Think I'm finally clean"
Taylor Swift,Wonderland,"Flashing lights and we
Took a wrong turn and we
Fell down the rabbit hole
You held on tight to me
'Cause nothing's as it seems
I'm spinning out of control

Didn't they tell us don't rush into things?
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds?

Ooh, didn't it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twisting around me
I should've slept with one eye open that night

We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it
Could last forever, eh

We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse
But never better, eh

In Wonderland, eh eh eh eh eh eh
In Wonderland, eh eh eh eh eh eh
In Wonderland, eh eh eh eh eh eh
In Wonderland, eh eh eh eh eh eh

So we went on our way
Too in love to think straight
All alone or so it seemed
But there were strangers watching
And whispers turned to talking
And talking turned to screams

Oh, didn't they tell us, ""Don't rush into things?""
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Didn't you calm my fears with a Cheshire cat smile?

Ooh, didn't it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twisting around me
It's all fun and games till somebody loses their mind

Oh, darling, we found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it
Could last forever, eh

We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse
But never better, eh

In Wonderland, eh eh eh eh eh eh
In Wonderland, eh eh eh eh eh eh
In Wonderland, eh eh eh eh eh eh
In Wonderland

I reach for you, but you were gone
I knew I had to go back home

You searched the world for something else
To make you feel like what we had
And in the end, in Wonderland
We both went mad

We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it
Could last forever (last forever)

We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse
But never better (never better)

We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it
Could last forever

We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse
But never better

In Wonderland"
Taylor Swift,You Are In Love,"One look, dark room
Meant just for you
Time moved too fast
You play it back

Buttons on a coat
Lighthearted joke
No proof, not much
But you saw enough

Small talk, he drives
Coffee at midnight
Blue light reflects
The chain on your neck

He says look up
And your shoulders brush
No proof, one touch
But you felt enough

You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love, you are in love

Morning, his place
Burnt toast, Sunday
You keep his shirt
He keeps his word

And for once you let go
Of your fears and your ghosts
One step, not much
But it said enough

You kiss on sidewalks
You fight and you talk
One night he wakes
Strange look on his face

Pauses, then says
""You're my best friend.""
And you knew what it was
He is in love

You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love

And so it goes
You two are dancing
In a snow globe round your neck
And he keeps the picture
Of you in his office downtown

And you understand now why they
Lost their minds and fought the wars
And why I've spent my whole life
Tryin' to put it into words

'Cause you can hear it in the silence
You can feel it on the way home
You can see it with the lights out
You are in love, true love
You're in love

You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love, you are in love

You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love, you are in love"
Taylor Swift,New Romantics,"We're all bored
We're all so tired of everything
We wait for
Trains that just aren't coming
We show off
Our different scarlet letters
Trust me, mine is better

We're so young
But we're on the road to ruin
We play dumb
But we know exactly what we're doin'
We cry tears
Of mascara in the bathroom
Honey, life is just a classroom

'Cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly

We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

We're all here
The lights and noise are blinding
We hang back
It's all in the timing
It's poker
He can't see it in my face
But I'm about to play my ace

We need love
But all we want is danger
We team up
Then switch sides like a record changer
The rumors
Are terrible and cruel
But honey, most of them are true (ah)

'Cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly

We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

So come on, come along with me
The best people in life are free

Please take my hand and
Please take me dancing and
Please leave me stranded
It's so romantic (it's so romantic)

'Cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

'Cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly

We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free"
Taylor Swift,State Of Grace,"I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love till it hurts or bleeds or fades in time

And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same

You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know is don't let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes

So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild

And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You're my Achilles' heel
This is the golden age of something good and right and real

And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same

I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right"
Taylor Swift,Red,"Loving him is like
Driving a new Maserati down a dead end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin
Ending so suddenly

Loving him is like
Trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn
So bright, just before they lose it all

Losing him was blue like I've never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you'd never met
But loving him was red, loving him was red

Touching him was like
Realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as
Easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song

Fighting with him was like
Trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like
Wishing you'd never found out that love could be that strong

Losing him was blue like I've never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you'd never met
But loving him was red, oh, red, burning red

Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head, in burning red
Burning, it was red

Losing him was blue like I'd ever known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you'd never met
'Cause loving him was red, yeah, yeah, red we're burning red

And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head
Comes back to me, burning red
His love was like
Driving a new Maserati down a dead end street"
Taylor Swift,Treacherous,"Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
Till the gravity is too much

And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I'd be smart to walk away
But you're quicksand

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I, I, I like it

I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay

And all we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But you're friction

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
I, I, I like it

Two headlights shine
Through the sleepless night
And I will get you,
Will get you alone

Your name has echoed
Through my mind
And I just think you should,
Think you should know

That nothing safe is
Worth the drive and I will
Follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home

This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I

Two headlights shine
Through the sleepless night
And I will get you,
Will get you alone

Your name has echoed
Through my mind
And I just think you should,
Think you should know

That nothing safe is
Worth the drive and I will
Follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home

I'll follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home

This slope is treacherous
I, I, I like it"
Taylor Swift,I Knew You Were Trouble,"Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you bound me, you bound me

I guess you didn't care and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me

And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Till you put me down
Oh, I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold, hard ground

Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning

Now I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see, now I see

He was long gone when he met me
And I realise the joke is on me, hey

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Till you put me down
Oh, I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been, yeah
Now I'm lying on the cold, hard ground

Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

And the saddest fear comes creeping in
That you never loved me, or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Till you put me down
Oh, I knew you were trouble when you walked in (You were right there)
So shame on me now (You were right there)
Flew me to places I'd never been(Oh)
Now I'm lying on the cold, hard ground

Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble"
Taylor Swift,All Too Well,"I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something about it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more
And I might be okay but I'm not fine at all...

'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin sized bed
And your mother's telling stories about you on the tee ball team
You taught me about your past thinking your future was me

And I know it's long gone and there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to...

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well

Well, maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
Till you tore it all up

Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well

And you call me up again
Just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel
In the name of being honest

I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all... too well

Time won't fly
It's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again
But I'm still trying to find it

After plaid shirt days
And nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things
And I walk home alone

But you keep my old scarf
From that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence
And it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

'Cause there we are again
Where I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well"
Taylor Swift,22,"It feels like a perfect night
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes
Ah-ah, ah-ah

It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers
Ah-ah, ah-ah

Yeah, we're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical
Oh yeah, tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time, oh-oh

I don't know about you, but I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing
Like we're twenty-two, twenty-two

It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids (Who's Taylor Swift anyway? Ew.)
Ah-ah, ah-ah

It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
And end up dreaming instead of sleeping

Yeah, we're happy, free, confused and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical
Oh yeah, tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
It's time, oh-oh

I don't know about you, but I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing
Like we're twenty-two, twenty-two (I don't know about you)
Twenty-two, twenty-two

It feels like one of those nights, we ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights, we won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights, you look like bad news
I gotta have you, I gotta have you

Ooh, ooh, yeah, hey!

I don't know about you, but I'm feeling twenty-two
(I don't know about you)
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to
(You don't know about me)
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing
(Dance like we're)
Like we're twenty-two, twenty-two (oh-woah-oh)
Twenty-two (dancing like)
Twenty-two (yeah, yeah)
Twenty-two (yeah, yeah, yeah)

It feels like one of those nights (Twenty-two), we ditch the whole scene

Taylor Swift,I Almost Do,"I bet this time of night, you’re still up
I bet you’re tired from a long, hard week
I bet you’re sittin' in your chair by the window, lookin' out at the city
And I bet sometimes you wonder about me

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don’t
I almost do, I almost do

I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
‘Cause each time you reach out, there’s no reply
I bet it never, ever occurred to you
That I can’t say hello to you and risk another goodbye

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don’t
I almost do, I almost do

Whoa, we made quite a mess, babe
It’s probably better off this way
And I confess, baby
In my dreams you’re touching my face
And askin' me if I wanna try again with you
And I almost do

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don’t
I almost do, I almost do

I bet this time of night you’re still up
I bet you’re tired from a long, hard week
I bet you’re sittin' in your chair by the window looking out at the city
And I hope sometimes you wonder about me"
Taylor Swift,We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,"I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, ""This is it, I've had enough""
'Cause like, we hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space...what?

Then you come around again and say
""Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me""
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, I love you

Ooh, we called it off again last night
But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you
 
We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together...like, ever

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

Ooh, you called me up again tonight
But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

Ooh (yeah)
Ooh (yeah)
Ooh (yeah)
Oh

I used to think that we were forever, ever
And I used to say ""Never say never...""
 
...So he calls me up, and he's like, ""I still love you,"" and I'm like, I mean this is exhausting.
You know, like we are never getting back together. Like, ever.

No, we are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

We, ooh, ooh, getting back together
We, ooh, oh, getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together"
Taylor Swift,Stay Stay Stay,"I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room at you
I was expecting some dramatic turnaway
But you stayed

This morning I said we should talk about it
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
And said ""Okay, let's talk.""

And I said ""Stay, stay, stay.
I've been loving you,
For quite some time, time, time.""
You think that it's funny
When I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best
If we both stay

Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing
I love you because you have given me no choice

But to stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you
For quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny
When I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best
If we both stay, stay, stay, stay

You took the time to memorize me
My fears, my hopes and dreams
I just like hanging out with you
All the time

All those times that you didn't leave
It's been occurring to me
I'd like to hang out with you
For my whole life

Stay
And I'll be loving you
For quite some time
No one else is gonna love me

When I get mad, mad, mad
So I think that it's best
If we both stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you
For quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny

When I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best
If we both stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you
For quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny
When I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best
If we both stay

That's so fun!"
Taylor Swift,The Last Time,"(Gary Lightbody)
Find myself at your door
Just like all those times before
I'm not sure how I got there
All roads they lead me here

I imagine you are home,
In your room, all alone,
And you open your eyes into mine,
And everything feels better.

(Both)
Right before your eyes,
I'm breaking
No past, no reasons why
Just you and me.

This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye.

(Taylor Swift)
You find yourself at my door
Just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave

And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
Everything is better

(Both)
Right before your eyes,
I'm aching
Run fast, nowhere to hide,
Just you and me.

This is the last time I'm asking you this,
Put my name at the top of your list.
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye.

Taylor Swift,Holy Ground,"I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone and, Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme

Took off faster than a green light, go
Hey, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day

And, darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We blocked the noise with the sound of ""I need you.""
And for the first time I had something to lose

And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
Sometimes I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd

'Cause, darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Tonight I'm gonna dance for all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance if I'm not dancing with you
Tonight I'm gonna dance like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance if I'm not dancing with you

It was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Tonight I'm gonna dance for all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance if I'm not dancing with you
Tonight I'm gonna dance like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance if I'm not dancing with you"
Taylor Swift,Sad Beautiful Tragic,"Long handwritten note, deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean, when you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be, and long they will wait

We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

In dreams, I meet you in long conversation
We both wake in lonely beds, in different cities
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
And you've got your demons and, darling, they all look like me

'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting
Silence, this train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen?
Hang up, give up, and for the life of us we can't get back

A beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic
Beautiful, tragic, beautiful

What we had, a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair"
Taylor Swift,The Lucky One,"New to town with a made-up name,
In the angel's city, chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream

You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
So overnight you look like a sixties queen

Another name goes up in lights
Like diamonds in the sky

And they'll tell you now
You're the lucky one
Yeah, they tell you now
You're the lucky one
But can you tell me now
You're the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh

Now it's big black cars and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page

And they tell you that you're lucky but you're so confused
'Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place

Another name goes up in lights
You wonder if you'll make it out alive

And they'll tell you now
You're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now
You're the lucky one

Can you tell me now
You're the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

It was a few years later I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity and got the hell out

They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the Rose Garden over Madison Square
And it took some time but I understand it now

'Cause now my name is up in lights
But I think you got it right

Let me tell you now
You're the lucky one
Let me tell you now
You're the lucky one
Let me tell you now
You're the lucky one
Oh, oh, oh

Yeah, they'll tell you now
You're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now
You're the lucky one

Can you tell me now
You're the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh"
Taylor Swift,Everything Has Changed,"Ed Sheeran
We good to go?

Taylor Swift
All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now, know something now
I didn't before

And all I've seen since eighteen hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles
And your smile in the back of my mind making me feel like

I just want to know you better
now you better, now you better now
I just want to know you better
now you better, now you better now

Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran
I just want to know you better
now you better, now you better now
I just want to know you
Know you, know you

'Cause all I know is we said hello
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed

All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours all i know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

Ed Sheeran
And all my walls
Stood tall painted blue
But I'll take them down
Take them down and open up the door for you.

Taylor Swift
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind, making up for lost time
Taking flight, making me feel like

Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran
I just want to know you better
Klnow you better, now you better now
I just want to know you better
now you better, now you better now

I just want to know you better

And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed

All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
I know it since yesterday
Is everything has changed

Come back and tell me why
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind

Taylor Swift
I just want to know you better
now you better, now you better now
I just want to know you
Know you, know you

Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran
All I know is we said hello
Your eyes look like coming home

Taylor Swift
All I know is we said hello
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know it is pouring rain

Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran
And everything has changed

Taylor Swift
All I know is a newfound grace
All my days I'll know your face
I know it since yesterday

Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran
Is everything has changed"
Taylor Swift,Starlight,"I said ""Oh my, what a marvelous tune.""
It was the best night
Never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight

I'm a Barbie on the boardwalk
Summer of '45
Picked me up late one night
Out the window, we were seventeen
And crazy, running wild, wild

Can't remember what song
It was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince

I said ""Oh my, what a marvelous tune.""
It was the best night
Never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

He said ""Look at you, worrying too much about,
Things you can't change.
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues
If you keep thinking that away.""

He was trying to skip rocks
On the ocean saying to me
""Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?""

Like oh my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night
Never would forget how we moved.
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

Ooh, ooh, he's talking crazy
Ooh, ooh, dancing with me
Ooh, ooh, we could get married
Have ten kids and teach 'em how to dream

Oh my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night
Never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines

And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

Like we dream impossible dreams
Like starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams

Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?"
Taylor Swift,Begin Again,"Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels
But I do
Turned the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song
But I do, I do

Walked in expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pulled my chair out and helped me in
And you don't know how nice that is
But I do

And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months thinking all love ever does
Is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again

You said you never met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you
But I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy
But I do

But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months thinking all love ever does
Is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again

And we walk down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies that your family watches
Every single Christmas
And I want to talk about that
For the first time, what's past is past

'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months thinking all love ever does
Is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again
But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again"
Taylor Swift,The Moment I Knew,"You should have been there
Should have burst through the door
With that ""Baby, I'm right here."" smile
And it would've felt like
A million little shining stars had just aligned
And I would've been so happy

Christmas lights glisten
I've got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking

People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said you'd be here
You said you'd be here

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
As I'm looking around the room
But there's one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew

And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall

And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly
""He said he'd be here.""

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
And asking me about you
But there's one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew

What do you say
When ears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know?
And what do you do
When the one who means the most to you
Is the one who didn't show?

You should have been here
And I would've been so happy

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all standing around me singing
""Happy birthday to you.""
But there's one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew

Ooh, I knew.

You call me later
And say ""I'm sorry I didn't make it.""
And I say ""I'm sorry, too.""
And that was the moment I knew"
Taylor Swift,Come Back... Be Here,"You said it in a simple way
Four a.m., the second day
How strange that I don't know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss then you catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall
I told myself, ""Don't get attached.""
But in my mind I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you

And this is when the feeling sinks in 
I don't wanna miss you like this 
Come back, be here
Come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here
Come back, be here

The delicate, beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can't put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would've played so nonchalant
Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I can't help but wish you took me with you

And this is when the feeling sinks in 
I don't wanna miss you like this 
Come back, be here
Come back, be here
I guess you're in London today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here
Come back, be here

This is falling in love in the cruelest way
This is falling for you when you are worlds away

In New York, be here
But you're in London
And I break down
This is not fair
That you're not around

And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here
Come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here
Come back, be here

I don't wanna miss you like this

Come back, be here
Come back, be here"
Taylor Swift,Girl At Home,"Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that

I don't even know her, but I feel a responsibility
To do what's upstanding and right
It's kinda like a code, yeah, and you've been getting closer and closer
And crossing so many lines

And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
But, honey, I am no one's exception
This I have previously learned

So don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
And I see you turn off your phone
And now you've got me alone
And I say
Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

I just wanna make sure, you understand perfectly
You're the kind of man who makes me sad
While she waits up, you chase down the newest thing
And take for granted what you have

And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
And, yeah, I might go with it
If I hadn't once been just like her

Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now you've got me alone
And I say
Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

Call a cab, lose my number
You're about to lose your girl
Call a cab, lose my number
Let's consider this lesson learned

Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
Wanna see you pick up your phone
And tell her you're coming home
Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

It would be a fine proposition
If I hadn't once been just like her"
Taylor Swift,Bad Blood,"'Cause baby now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done
'Cause baby now we've got bad blood, hey

Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood, hey

Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin
What was shining? Now it's all rusted

Did you have to hit me?
where I'm weak, baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me

Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey

Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood, hey

Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars on my back from your knife
So don't think it's in the past
These kind of wounds, they last and they last

Now did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal but this won't
So if you're coming my way, just don't

Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey

Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood, hey

Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
You live like that, you live with ghosts
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
You live like that, you live with ghosts

Mmm, if you love like that blood runs cold

'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey

Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood, hey

'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey

Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood, hey"
Taylor Swift,Mine,"You were in college working part-time waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts

I say, ""Can you believe it?""
As we're lying on the couch
The moment I can see it
Yes, yes
I can see it now

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Flash forward and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

And I remember that fight, 2:30 AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street

Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said I'll never leave you alone

You said
I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine

Hold on
Make it last
Hold on
Never turn back

You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter (hold on)
You are the best thing that's ever been mine (hold on)

(Oh yeah)
Yes, yes, do you believe it? (hold on)
Yes, yes we're gonna make it now (hold on)
Yes, yes, I can see it (come on, come on)
I can see it now"
Taylor Swift,Sparks Fly,"The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless that you send me running but I
Kind of know that I won't get far.

And you stood there in front of me just
Close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see
What I was thinking of

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

Get me with those green eyes, baby
As the lights go down
Something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

My mind forgets to remind me
That you're a bad idea
You touch me once and it's really something
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be

I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you, I know it's no good
And I could wait patiently but
I really wish you would

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile

Get me with those green eyes, baby
As the lights go down
Something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile

I run my fingers through your hair
And watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me
It's just strong enough to make you feel right
And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow
I'm captivated by you, baby
Like a fireworks show

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

Get me with those green eyes, baby
As the lights go down
Something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile"
Taylor Swift,Back To December,"I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me how's your family
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up, and I know why
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses, and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right
I go back to December all the time

These days, I haven't been sleeping
Staying up, playing back myself leavin'
When your birthday passed, and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall
And then the cold came
The dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love
And all I gave you was ""Goodbye""

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand

But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December...
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
All the time"
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,"I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry

This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say

Don’t say ""Yes"", run away now
I’ll meet you when you’re out of the church at the back door
Don’t wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, ""Speak now""

Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play
A song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be

She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me, don’t you?

Don’t say ""Yes"", run away now
I’ll meet you when you’re out of the church at the back door
Don’t wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, ""Speak now""

Don’t say ""Yes"", run away now
I’ll meet you when you’re out of the church at the back door
Don’t wait or say a single vow
Your time is running out
And they said, ""Speak now""

Oh, run away
La la, oh oh
Say a single vow

I hear the preacher say, ""Speak now or forever hold your peace""
There’s the silence, there’s my last chance
I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But I’m only looking at you

I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

Don’t say ""Yes"", run away now
I’ll meet you when you’re out of the church at the back door
Don’t wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, ""Speak now""
And you’ll say ""Let’s run away now
I’ll meet you when I’m out of my tux at the back door
Baby, I didn’t say my vows
So glad you were around
When they said, 'Speak now'"""
Taylor Swift,Dear John,"Long were the nights, when my days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps, praying the floor won't fall through, again
My mother accused me of losing my mind, but I swore I was fine

You paint a blue sky, then go back and turn it to rain
When I lived in your chess game, but you changed the rules every day
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone tonight
Well, I stopped picking up, and this song to let you know why

Dear John
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I should've known

Well, maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need to give love then take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand
And I'll look back and regret, I ignored when they said run as fast as you can

Dear John
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home

Dear John
I see it all now, it was wrong
Don't you think nineteen's too young 
To be played by your dark, twisted games?
When I loved you so
I should've known

You are an expert at Sorry!
And keeping lines blurry
Never impressed
By me acing your tests
All the girls that you run dry
Have tired lifeless eyes
'Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches
Before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks
Over your sad, empty town

Dear John
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home

I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress wrote you a song
You should've known
You should've known

Don't you think I was too young?
You should've known"
Taylor Swift,Mean,"You, with your words like knives and swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again, got me feeling like I'm nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard, calling me out when I'm wounded
You, pickin' on the weaker man

You can take me down 
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know

Someday I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

You, with your switching sides and your walk-by lies and your humiliation
You, have pointed out my flaws again as if I don't already see them
I'll walk with my head down trying to block you out 'cause I'll never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again

I'll bet you got pushed around, somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now, 'cause you can't lead me down that road
And you don't know what you don't know

Someday I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

And I can see you years from now in a bar, talking over a football game
With that same big loud opinion, but nobody's listening
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing

But all you are is mean
All you are is mean and a liar and pathetic and alone in life
And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean

But someday I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

Someday, I'll be, living in a big old city
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?"
Taylor Swift,The Story Of Us,"I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks flew instantly
And people would say, ""They're the lucky ones""
I used to know my place was the spot next to you
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat
'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on

Oh, a simple complication, 
Miscommunications lead to fallout
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up, I can't break through

Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know, is it killing you
Like it's killing me, yeah
I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us
Looks a lot like a tragedy now

Next chapter!

How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy
And you're doing your best to avoid me
I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride, like you should've held me

Oh, I'm scared to see the ending 
Why are we pretending this is nothing?
I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite this loud

Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know, is it killing you
Like it's killing me, yeah
I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us
Looks a lot like a tragedy now

This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
If you say you'd rather love than fight

So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon

Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know, is it killing you
Like it's killing me, yeah
But I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us
Looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now

And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know, is it killing you
Like it's killing me, yeah
I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate
'Cause we're going down
And the story of us
Looks a lot like a tragedy now

The end."
Taylor Swift,Never Grow Up,"Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter 'cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light

To you everything's funny
You've got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have, honey
If you could stay like that

Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up
Just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up
It could stay this simple

I won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
No, no one will desert you
Just try to never grow up
Never grow up

You're in the car on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
At fourteen there is just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots

But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she's getting older, too
And don't lose the way that you dance around in your PJ's
Getting ready for school

Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up
Just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up
It could stay this simple

And no one's ever burned you
Nothing's ever left you scarred
And even though you want to
Just try to never grow up

Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone

So here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on

Wish I'd never grown up
I wish I'd never grown up

Oh, I don't wanna grow up
Wish I'd never grown up
Could still be little
Oh, I don't wanna grow up
Wish I'd never grown up
It could still be simple

Oh, darling don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up
Just stay this little
Oh, darling don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up
It could stay this simple

I won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
And even though you want to
Please try to never grow up

Don't you ever grow up
Never grow up
Just never grow up"
Taylor Swift,Enchanted,"There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you

Your eyes whispered, have we met?
Cross the room your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing on the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you know
I was enchanted to meet you

The lingering question kept me up
Two a.m., who do you love?
I wonder till I'm wide awake
And now I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say
Hey, it was enchanting to meet you
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you know
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing 'round all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you know
I was enchanted to meet you

This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the storyline ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaning to say
I was enchanted to meet you

Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you know
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing 'round all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you know
I was enchanted to meet you

Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you"
Taylor Swift,Better Than Revenge,"Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did.

The story starts when it was hot and it was summer
And I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say sabotage

I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, woah
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, woah
Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list 
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling
She thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things

But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you want to go
They don't teach you that in prep school, so it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity

(Think about what you did.)

She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, woah
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, woah
Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

I'm just another thing for you roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but haven't you heard?
I'm just another thing for you roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but I always get the last word

Woah...


She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, woah
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, woah
Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
'Cause I don't think you do
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
I don't think you do
I don't think you do

Let's hear the applause
Come on, show me how much better you are
See you deserve some applause
'Cause you're so much better!
She took him faster than you can say sabotage..."
Taylor Swift,Innocent,"I guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your warpath
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind trying to get it back

Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything?
And everybody believed in you?

It's all right, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent

Did some things you can't speak of
But at night you live it all again
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
If only you'd seen what you know now then

Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catching days?
And everything out of reach someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn't it beautiful, running wild till you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught up to you?

It's all right, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, life is a tough crowd
Thirty two and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent

Time turns flames to embers
You'll have new Septembers
Every one of us has messed up, too
Lives change like the weather
I hope you remember
Today is never too late to be brand new

It's all right, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, life is a tough crowd
Thirty two and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent

Lost your balance on the tightrope
It's never too late to get back"
Taylor Swift,Haunted,"You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought I'd live to see it break
It's getting dark and it's all too quiet
And I can't trust anything now
And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake

Oh, I'm holding my breath
Won't lose you again
Something's made your eyes go cold

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back, now I'm haunted

Stood there, watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time
I'm wishing he was you instead

Oh, I'm holding my breath
Won't see you again
Something keeps me holding on to nothing

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back, now I'm haunted

I know
I know

I just know
You're not gone
You can't be gone
No

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back, now I'm haunted

Oh

You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Though I never thought I'd see it break
Never thought I'd see it"
Taylor Swift,Last Kiss,"I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at one fifty-eight
The words that you whispered, for just us to know
You told me you loved me, so why did you go away?

If I do recall now, the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement, I ran off the plane
That July ninth, the beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt, I can still feel your arms

But now I'll go
Sit on the floor, wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss

I never thought we'd have our last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

I do remember the swing in your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in
I'm not much for dancing, but for you I did

Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions

And now I'll go
Sit on the floor, wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss

I never thought we'd have our last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

So I'll watch your life in pictures
Like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me
Like I used to feel you breathe
And I'll keep up with our old friends
Just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are

And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you, you wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in the weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind

So I'll go
Sit on the floor, wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss

I never thought we'd have our last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Forever the name on my lips
Just like our last"
Taylor Swift,Long Live,"I said, ""Remember this moment""
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild

We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew
Our lives would never be the same

You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live
The walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined
Just for me and you

I was screaming, long live
All the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
One day
We will be remembered

I said, ""Remember this feeling?""
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now

We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town

And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, ""This is absurd!""
'Cause for a moment a band of thieves in ripped-up jeans
Got to rule the world

Long live
The walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined
Just for me and you

I was screaming, long live
All the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Long live
All the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you

I was screaming, long live
That look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day
We will be remembered

Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

Can you take a moment
Promise me this
That you'll stand by me forever
But if, God forbid, fate should step in

And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name

Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine

Long live 
The walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life
With you

Long, long live
The walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined
Just for me and you

And I was screaming, long live
All the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Singing, long live
All the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you

And long, long live
That look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day
We will be remembered"
Camila Cabello,Crying in the Club,"You think, that you'll die without him
You know, that's a lie that you tell yourself

David Guetta,2U,"No limit in the sky
That I won't fly for ya
No amount of tears in my eyes
That I won't cry for ya, oh no
With every breath that I take
I want you to share that air with me
There's no promise that I won't keep
I'll climb a mountain, there's none too steep

When it comes to you
There's no crime
Let's take both of our souls
And intertwine
When it comes to you
Don't be blind
Watch me speak from my heart
When it comes to you
Comes to you

Want you to share that

Cupid in a line
Arrow got your name on it, oh yeah
Don't miss out on a love
And regret yourself on it, oh
Open up your mind, clear your head
Ain't gotta wake up to an empty bed
Share my life, it's yours to keep
Now that I give to you all of me, oh

When it comes to you
There's no crime
Let's take both of our souls

Comes to you"
Céline Dion,"My Heart Will Go On - Love Theme from ""Titanic""","Every night in my dreams

Go on

Near

The heart does go on
Once more

Michael Learns To Rock,Forever And A Day,"When the night has come
And the day is done
I'm always thinking of you
You are in the air
You are everywhere
In the every thing I do

If I could keep this moment in time
If I could make you forever mine
Baby I'm lost in your love
From heaven above
You came to bring me up

With you I feel I could stay
In love forever and a day

When I walk alone
Through an empty home
I just can't stop thinking of you
Do you feel the pain
Could it be the same
Are you missing me too

I see your face when I close my eyes
I see a glimpse of your own paradise
You came from heaven above
I'm lost in your love

Free as the wind
You give me wings to fly
My girl I feel I could stay
In love forever and a day

I feel that I could stay
In love forever and a day"
Michael Learns To Rock,The Ghost Of You,"Summer's ended and without a trace
Time goes by - while you remain
Funny how I thought I walked on through
With my heart in one

Why do I still cry for you
Dying to get close to you Oh baby
Why do I still fear to face
The ghost of you

How I tried to get you of my mind
But you return - all the time
I believed I could just let you go
Like the fool I am, Baby...

Why do I still cry for you
Dying to get close to you
Oh baby why do I still fear to face
The ghost of you

I've been trying to release you
To get my feet back on the ground
Still I need my hope to hold on to
Even if I know I should back away
It's just a part of me that I can't erase, hey...

Why do I still cry for you
Dying to get close to you
Why do I still fear to face

Michael Learns To Rock,You Took My Heart Away,"Staring at the moon so blue
Turning all my thoughts to you
I was without hopes or dreams
Try to dull an inner scream
But you saw me through

You took my heart away
When my whole world was gray
You gave me everything
And a little bit more
And when it's cold at night
And you sleep by my side
You become the meaning of my life

Living in a world so cold
You were there to warm my soul
You came to mend a broken heart
You gave my life a brand new start
And now I'm in love

You took my heart away
When my whole world was gray
You gave me everything
And a little bit more
And when it's cold at night
And you sleep by my side
You become the meaning of my life

Holding your hand
I won't fear tomorrow
Here where we stand
We'll never be alone

You took my heart away

You become the meaning
You become the meaning of my life"

I've never seen
Such a lovely queen

Crazy like this before

Paint my love
You should paint my love
It's the picture of a thousand sunsets
It's the freedom of a thousand doves

Been around the world
Then I met you, girl
It's like coming home
To a place I've known

Paint my love
You should paint my love
It's the picture of a thousand sunsets
It's the freedom of a thousand doves

Since you came into my life
The days before all fade to black or white
Since you came into my life

Michael Learns To Rock,Take Me To Your Heart,"Hiding from the rain and snow
Trying to forget but I won't let go
Looking at a crowded street
Listening to my own heart beat

So many people all around the world
Tell me where do I find someone like you girl

Take me to your heart, take me to your soul
Give me your hand before I'm old
Show me what love is, haven't got a clue
Show me that wonders can be true

They say nothing lasts forever
We're only here today
Love is now or never
Bring me far away

Take me to your heart, take me to your soul
Give me your hand and hold me
Show me what love is, be my guiding star
It's easy, take me to your heart

Standing on a mountain high
Looking at the moon through a clear blue sky
I should go and see some friends
But they don't really comprehend

Don't need too much talking without saying anything
All I need is someone who makes me wanna sing

Take me to your heart, take me to your soul
Give me your hand before I'm old
Show me what love is, haven't got a clue
Show me that wonders can be true

They say nothing lasts forever
We're only here today
Love is now or never
Bring me far away

Take me to your heart, take me to your soul
Give me your hand and hold me
Show me what love is, be my guiding star
It's easy, take me to your heart
(Take me, take me)

Take me to your heart, take me to your soul
Give me your hand and hold me
Show me what love is, be my guiding star
It's easy, take me to your heart"
Michael Learns To Rock,25 Minutes,"(Jascha Richter, Diane Warren)

After some time I've finally made up my mind
She is the girl and I really want to make her mine
I'm searching everywhere to find her again
To tell her I love her
And I'm sorry about the things I've done

I find her standing in front of the church
The only place in town where I didn't search
She looks so happy in her wedding dress
But she's crying while she's saying this

Boy, I've missed your kisses all the time
But this is twenty-five minutes too late
Though you traveled so far
Boy, I'm sorry you are twenty-five minutes too late

Against the wind I'm going home again
Wishing me back to the time
When we were more than friends

But still I see her in front of the church
The only place in town where I didn't search
She looked so happy in her wedding dress
But she cried while she was saying this

Boy, I've missed your kisses all the time
But this is twenty-five minutes too late
Though you traveled so far
Boy, I'm sorry you are twenty-five minutes too late

Out in the streets places where hungry hearts have nothing to eat
Inside my head, still I can hear the words she said
(Hear the words she)

Boy, I've missed your kisses all the time
But this is twenty-five minutes too late
Though you traveled so far
Boy, I'm sorry you are twenty-five minutes too late

Boy, I've missed your kisses all the time
(I've missed your kisses all the time)
But this is twenty-five minutes too late
(It's too late)
Though you traveled so far
(You traveled so far)
Boy, I'm sorry you are twenty-five minutes too late
I can still hear her say"
Ronan Keating,Iris,"And I'd give up forever to touch you
'Cause I know that you feel me somehow
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be
And I don't want to go home right now

And all I can taste is this moment
And all I can breathe is your life
Cause sooner or later it's over
I just don't want to miss you tonight

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
Or the moment of truth in your lies
When everything seems like the movies
Yeah you bleed just to know you're alive

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am"
Ronan Keating,Stay,"I've been sitting here staring at the clock on the wall
And I've been laying here praying, praying she won't call
It's just another call from home
And you'll get it and be gone and I'll be crying

And I'll be begging you, baby, beg you not to leave
But I'll be left here waiting
With my Heart on my sleeve
Oh, for the next time we'll be here
Seems like a million years and I think I'm dying

What do I have to do to make you see
He can't love you like me?

Why don't you stay, I'm down on my knees
I'm so tired of being lonely
Don't I give you what you need
When he calls you to go
There is one thing you should know
We don't have to live this way
Baby, why don't you stay

I can't take it any longer
But my will is getting stronger
And I think I know just what I have to do
I can't waste another minute
After all that I've put in it
I've given you my best
Why does she get the best of you
So next time you find
You wanna leave her bed for mine

Why don't you stay, I'm up of my knees
I'm so tired of being lonely
You can't give you what I need
When he begs you not to go
There is one thing you should know
I don't have to live this way
Baby, why don't you stay

Baby, why don't you stay"
Ronan Keating,This I Promise You,"My love, here I stand before you
I am yours now from this moment on
Take my hand, only you can stop me shaking
We'll share forever, this I promise you

And when I look in your eyes
All of my life is before me
And I'm not running anymore
'Cause I already know I'm home
With every beat of my heart
I'll give you my love completely
My darling, this I promise you

My love, I can feel your heartbeat
As we dance now closer than before
Don't let go, 'cause I could almost cry now
This is forever, I make this vow to you

My darling, this I promise you
My darling, this I promise you"
Ronan Keating,If Tomorrow Never Comes,"Sometimes late at night
I lie awake and watch her sleeping
She's lost in peaceful dreams
So I turn out the light and lay there in the dark
And the thought crosses my mind
If I never wake in the morning
Would she ever doubt the way I feel
About her in my heart

If tomorrow never comes
Will she know how much I loved her
Did I try in every way to show her every day
That she's my only one
And if my time on earth were through
And she must face this world without me
Is the love I gave her in the past
Gonna be enough to last
If tomorrow never comes

'Cause I've lost loved ones in my life
Who never knew how much I loved them
Now I live with the regret
That my true feelings for them never were revealed
So I made a promise to myself
To say each day how much she means to me
And avoid that circumstance
Where there's no second chance to tell her how I feel

If tomorrow never comes
Will she know how much I loved her
Did I try in every way to show her every day
That she's my only one
And if my time on earth were through
And she must face this world without me
Is the love I gave her in the past
Gonna be enough to last
If tomorrow never comes

So tell that someone that you love
Just what you're thinking of
If tomorrow never comes"
Ronan Keating,When You Say Nothing At All,"It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart
Without saying a word, you can light up the dark
Try as I may, I can never explain
What I hear when you don't say a thing

There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me wherever I fall
You say it best (say it best)
When you say nothing at all

All day long, I can hear people talking out loud
But when you hold me near, you drown out the crowd 
Try as they may, they could never define
What's been said between your heart and mine

Take That,Patience,"Just have a little patience
I'm still hurting from a love I lost
I'm feeling your frustration
But any minute all the pain will stop

Just hold me close
Inside your arms tonight
Don't be too hard on my emotions

'Cause I need time
My heart is numb, has no feeling
So while I'm still healing
Just try and have a little patience

I really wanna start over again
I know you wanna be my salvation
The one that I can always depend

I'll try to be strong
Believe me, I'm trying to move on
It's complicated but understand me

'Cause I need time
My heart is numb, has no feeling
So while I'm still healing
Just try and have a little patience, yeah

Have a little patience, yeah
'Cause these scars run so deep
It's been hard
But I have to believe

That some things are meant to be

But you showed me that they do
You know that I learn something new
Everyday I love you

'Cause I believe that destiny
Is out of our control (Don't you know that I do?)

Walking down the streets of Nothingville
Where our love was young and free

Westlife,What About Now,"Shane:
Shadows fill an empty heart
As love is fading,
From all the things that we are
But are not saying
Can we see beyond the stars,
And make it to the dawn?

Change the colours of the sky
And open up to the ways you made me feel alive,
The ways I loved you
For all the things that never died,
To make it through the night,
Love will find you

All:
What about now?
What about today?
What if you're making me all that I was meant to be?
What if our love never went away?
What if it's lost behind words we could never find?
Baby, before it's too late,
What about now?

The sun is breaking in your eyes
To start a new day
This broken heart can still survive
With a touch of your grace
Shadows fade into the light
I am by your side,
Where love will find you

What about today?
What if you're making me all that I was meant to be?

When I am down and, oh my soul so weary
When troubles come and my heart burdened be

Until you come and sit awhile with me

I am strong, when I am on your shoulders
You raise me up... To more than I can be

Shayne Ward,Something Worth Living For,"I don't wanna leave you here all by yourself
I just wanna let you know I'm there for you like no one else
I don't wanna drift up to another place
I just wanna lay here in your arms with your hand on my face

So lets not ever tell the moon about the sun
I'll keep hearing love songs, hoping every wrongs undone
Its foolish but we've only just begun
I don't wanna stop this, all my walls are caving in

I wanna give you something worth living for
I wanna tell you this and so much more
You're my everything
My universe

I'm so mesmerised by your serenity
Hopefully you'll take me there inside your dreams
Just like all the leaves I'm falling over you
It's so unbelieveable the airs so true"
Shayne Ward,Breathless,"If our love was a fairy tale
I would charge in and rescue you
On a yacht baby we would sail
To an island where we'd say I do

And if we had babies they would look like you
It'd be so beautiful if that came true
You don't even know how very special you are

You leave me breathless
You're everything good in my life
You leave me breathless
I still can't believe that you're mine
You just walked out of one of my dreams
So beautiful you're leaving me
Breathless

And if our love was a story book


We would meet on the very first page
The last chapter would be about
How I'm thankful for the life we've made

And if we had babies they would have your eyes
I would fall deeper watching you give life
You don't even know how very special you are

You must have been sent from heaven to earth to change me
You're like an angel
The thing that I feel is stronger than love believe me
You're something special
I only hope that I'll one day deserve what you've given me
But all I can do is try
Every day of my life"

Undid a lot of ties
Fought a lot of fights

It's kinda funny, how life can change
Can flip 180 in a matter of days

One love for the times we cried
One love gotta stay alive
I will survive
One love for the city streets
One love for the hip hop beats

One love is all we need

Late at night I'm still wide awake
Think this is far more than I can take

So hard to see
That a woman like you could wait around for a man like me

And I know just where I'm going
Packed up my troubles and I've thrown them all away

Pardon the way that I stare
There's nothing else to compare
The sight of you leaves me weak
There are no words left to speak

But if you feel like I feel
Please let me know that it's real
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off you

I love you, baby
And if it's quite alright, I need you, baby
To warm a lonely night, I love you, baby

Don't bring me down, I pray, oh pretty baby
Now that I found you, stay
And let me love you, baby
Let me love you.

Evanescence,My Immortal,"I'm so tired of being here
Suppressed by all my childish fears
And if you have to leave
I wish that you would just leave
'Cause your presence still lingers here
And it won't leave me alone

These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase

When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me

You used to captivate me
By your resonating light
Now I'm bound by the life you left behind
Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams
Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me

These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase

When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me

I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone
But though you're still with me
I've been alone all along

When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me
Me

Imagine Dragons,Whatever It Takes,"Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling is vulturous
Negative, Nepotist

Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

Whip, whip
Run me like a race horse
Hold me like a rip cord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains

Whatever it takes
You take me to the top, I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging onto the visual
I wanna be invisible

Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough from the particle sum
I was born to run, I was born for this

Whip, whip
Run me like a race horse
Hold me like a rip cord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains

Whatever it takes
You take me to the top, I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical
Hypothetical, working onto something that I'm proud of
Out of the box an epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost

I'm an apostrophe, I'm just a symbol to reminds you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece and yet I'm half diseased
And when I am deceased

At least I go down to the grave and die happily
Leave the body of my soul to be a part of me
I do what it takes

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains

Whatever it takes
Ya take me to the top, I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes"

Taking my sulking to the masses
Write down my poems for the few
Who looked at me took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Take up my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the

Pain
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Pain
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my god, they came from
Pain
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh
Your spirit up above, oh-ooh

I was choking in the crowd
Living my brain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke up and it rained down
It rained down, like

Pain
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain
You break me down, you built me up, believer, believer
Pain
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my god, they came from
Pain
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Last things last
By the grace of the fire and the flames
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh

Inhibited, limited
Till it broke up and it rained down
You rained down, like

It feels just like it's heaven's touch
Together at the top (at the top baby), like a pyramid
And even when the wind is blowing
We'll never fall just keep on going
Forever we will stay, like a pyramid

Like a pyramid like a pyramid eh (ooh)
Like a pyramid like a pyramid eh (ooh)

Cold (cold), never ever when you're close (close)
We will never let it fold (fold)
A story that was never told
Something like a mystery (yoh!)
And every step we took we've grown
Look how fast the time has flown
A journey to a place unknown
We're going down in history
Earthquakes can't shake us (oh)
Cyclones can't break us (oh)
Hurricanes can't take away our love

Pyramid, we built this on a solid rock (hey!)

Together at the top, (at the top baby) like a pyramid

Forever we will stay, like a pyramid (eh oh)

Like a pyramid girl let me show you
That I love you so much
That we gonna get through (oh oh)
Even when there's storms
I will never go, Ima be the one to keep you safe (hey)
Before was our love back it up more than enough
Holding on to one another be the cover when it's rough (oh oh)
Mother nature (hey) or disaster won't stop at happy ever after

Pyramid, keep it going (like a pyramid, like a pyramid)
Oh oh ooh (like a pyramid, like a pyramid)

Pyramid, we built this on a solid rock (solid rock)
It feels just like it's heaven's touch (ooh)

Ed Sheeran,Homeless,"Could I wake up next to you
When we're hitting double figures
Look into your eyes
Like I'm looking into double mirrors
Could you make it any clearer
Everything's such a blur
It's not my turn
It's hers to get hurt
On a late night
Coming home from way too many train rides
Lace not as red as my face
I'm home at the same time
Highbury estate's fine
Smoking like a dragon, but don't chase lines

I haven't slept for the past week
Two hours ain't enough for me
I feel inspired, at quarter to three am
I haven't changed since our last meet
I'm still getting all my meals for free
Think I'm being shunned by my feet again

It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be

And now I'm sitting on a night bus
Flicking through my Ipod
Feeling kinda tired 
So I try to close my eyes up
Driver, turn the lights off
Lights on, on stage, mics on

Song plays, nice one
Gotta keep my hype strong
Truth be, never went to Uni
People see right through me
But I'm not a fool, see
I'm never gonna do one
Gonna live past 22, done
Everything I need to
Except get a 2:1

I haven't slept for the past week
Two hours ain't enough for me
I feel inspired, at quarter to three am
I haven't changed since our last meet
I'm still getting all my food for free
Think I'm being shunned by my feet again

It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be

When I feel cold
You keep me warm
And I'm not looking for some loose change
Just wanna find a true mate
Who wants to be my duvet

It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be"
Bastille,Pompeii,"I was left to my own devices
Many days fell away with nothing to show

And the walls kept tumbling down
In the city that we love
Grey clouds roll over the hills
Bringing darkness from above

But if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?
And if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like you've been here before?
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?

We were caught up and lost in all of our vices
In your pose as the dust settled around us

And the walls kept tumbling down
In the city that we love
Grey clouds roll over the hills
Bringing darkness from above

But if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?
And if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like you've been here before?
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?

Oh, where do we begin
The rubble or our sins?
Oh, where do we begin
The rubble or our sins?

(Oh, where do we begin) And the walls kept tumbling down
In the city that we love (The rubble or our sins?)
(Oh, where do we begin) Grey clouds roll over the hills
Bringing darkness from above (The rubble or our sins?)

But if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?
And if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like you've been here before?
Oh, how am I gonna be an optimist about this?
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?
If you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?"
Ed Sheeran,Cold Coffee,"She's like cold coffee in the morning
I'm drunk off last nights whisky and coke
She'll make me shiver without warning
And make me laugh as if I'm in on the joke

And you can stay with me forever
Or you could stay with me for now

Tell me if I'm wrong 
Tell me if I'm right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight
Tell me if I know
Tell me if I do
Tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to

I'll wake with coffee in the morning
But she prefers two lumps of sugar and tea
Outside the day is up and calling
But I don't have to be so, please go back to sleep

Stay with me forever
Or you could stay with me for now

Tell me if I'm wrong

Tell me if I'm right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight
Tell me if I know
Tell me if I do
Tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to

'Cause I love the way you wake me up
For goodness sake will my love not be enough?

Tell me if I'm wrong
Tell me if I'm right
Tell me if you need a loving hand 
To help you fall asleep tonight
Tell me if I know
Tell me if I do
Tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to

Tell me if I'm wrong
Tell me if I'm right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight"
Lukas Graham,7 Years,"Once I was seven years old my momma told me
Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
Once I was seven years old

It was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure

Once I was eleven years old my daddy told me
Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely
Once I was eleven years old

I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about the glory, just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once I was 20 years old

I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later

Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
I was writing about everything, I saw before me
Once I was 20 years old

Soon we'll be 30 years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still rolling
Soon we'll be 30 years old

I'm still learning about life
My woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs
And I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me
Some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind
My brother I'm still sorry

Soon I'll be 60 years old, my daddy got 61
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made the man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit, once or twice a month

Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me
Soon I'll be 60 years old
Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me
Soon I'll be 60 years old

Once I was seven years old, my momma told me
Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
Once I was seven years old

Once I was seven years old"
Taylor Swift,Blank Space,"Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sins
Saw you there and I thought

""Oh my God, look at that face!""
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?

New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny, rumors fly
And I know you heard about me

So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over (mmm)
If the high was worth the pain

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless (mmm)
Or with a nasty scar

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen

Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come
Oh no

Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second-guessing like

""Oh my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over (mmm)
If the high was worth the pain

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless (oh)
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless (mmm)
Or with a nasty scar

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over (over)
If the high was worth the pain

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far (ooh)
It'll leave you breathless (mmm)

'Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming
All night, no sleep
'Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming
'Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming

Sometimes I tend to lose myself when I'm out here on my own
I never seem to get it right, but I guess that is how it goes
Ever since you came around, can't nobody hold me down
You showed me how to find myself when I needed it the most

I been up all night, no sleep
'Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming
All night, no sleep
'Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming
Wide awake, that's okay as long as I'm with you
I'll be up all night, no sleep
'Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming

I'm never gonna find my way
If I don't run to that goal
The past is the past, today is today
And there are things I can't control
The circles underneath my eyes
Tell the truth I've been trying to hide
I've been waiting for you way too long
Won't you come and take me home
Oh I, I'm praying this ain't all a dream
Can you, you, wake me up before you leave

I been up all night, no sleep
'Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming

Somehow, one step closer

I have died everyday waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid, I have loved you
For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

Time stands still, beauty in all she is
I will be brave, I will not let anything take away
Standing in front of me, every breath
Every hour has come to this, one step closer

I have died everyday waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid, I have loved you
For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more, one step closer, one step closer

I have died everyday waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid, I have loved you

O-Town,All or Nothing,"I know when he's been on your mind
That distant look is in your eyes
I thought with time you'd realize it's over, over

It's not the way I choose to live
And something somewhere's got to give
As sharing this relationship gets older, older

You know I'd fight for you
But how can I fight someone who isn't even there?
I've had the rest of you, now I want the best of you
I don't care if that's not fair

'Cause I want it all or nothing at all
There's no where left to fall
When you reach the bottom, it's now or never
Is it all, or are we just friends?
Is this how it ends, with a simple telephone call?
You leave me here, with nothing at all

There are times it seems to me
I'm sharing you in memories
I feel it in my heart but I don't show it, show it
And then there's times you look at me
As though I'm all that you can see
There's times I don't believe it's right, I know it, know it

Don't make me promises
Baby you never did know how to keep them well
I've had the rest of you, now I want the best of you
It's time to show and tell

'Cause I want it all or nothing at all
There's nowhere left to fall
When you reach the bottom, it's now or never
Is it all, or are we just friends?
Is this how it ends, with a simple telephone call?
You leave me here, with nothing at all

Cause you and I
Could lose it all if you've got no more room
Nowhere, inside, for me in your life

'Cause I want it all or nothing at all
There's nowhere left to fall its now or never

Is it all or nothing at all?
There's nowhere left to fall
When you reach the bottom, it's now or never
Is it all, or are we just friends?
Is this how it ends, with a simple telephone call?
You leave me here, with nothing at all

Is it all or nothing at all?
There's nowhere left to fall
When you reach the bottom, it's now or never
Is it all, or are we just friends?
Is this how it ends, with a simple telephone call?
You leave me here, with nothing at all"
Emma Watson,Belle,"(Belle)
Little town, it's a quiet village
Every day like the one before
Little town, full of little people
Waking up to say

(Ensemble)
Bonjour! Bonjour
Bonjour! Bonjour! Bonjour

(Belle)
There goes the baker with his tray, like always
The same old bread and rolls to sell
Every morning just the same
Since the morning that we came
To this poor, provincial town

(MONSIEUR JEAN, spoken)
Good Morning, Belle

(BELLE, spoken)
Good morning, Monsieur Jean
Have you lost something again?

(MONSIEUR JEAN, spoken)
Well, I believe I have
Problem is, I've-I can't remember what
Oh well, I'm sure it'll come to me
Where are you off to?

(Belle)
To return this book to Père Robert
It's about two lovers in fair Verona

(MONSIEUR JEAN, spoken)
Sounds boring

(Ensemble)
Look there she goes, that girl is strange, no question
Dazed and distracted, can't you tell?
Never part of any crowd
'Cause her head's up on some cloud
No denying she's a funny girl that Belle

Bonjour! Good day! How is your family?
Bonjour! Good day! How is your wife?
I need six eggs! That's too expensive

(Belle)
There must be more than this provincial life

(PERE ROBERT, spoken)
Ah, if it isn't the only bookworm in town
So, where did you run off to this week?

(BELLE, spoken)
Two cities in Northern Italy
I didn't want to come back
Have you got any new places to go?

(PERE ROBERT, spoken)
I'm afraid not...
But you may re-read any of the old ones that you'd like

(BELLE, spoken)
Your library makes our small corner of the world feel big

(PERE ROBERT, spoken)
Bon voyage

(Ensemble)
Look there she goes, the girl is so peculiar
I wonder if she's feeling well
With a dreamy, far-off look
And her nose stuck in a book
What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle

(Belle)
Oh, isn't this amazing?
It's my favourite part because-you'll see
Here's where she meets Prince Charming
But she won't discover that it's him till Chapter Three

(Ensemble)
Now it's no wonder that her name means ""Beauty""
Her looks have got no parallel
But behind that fair facade
I'm afraid she's rather odd
Very diff'rent from the rest of us
She's nothing like the rest of us
Yes, diff'rent from the rest of us is Belle

(GASTON, spoken)
Look at her, LeFou-my future wife
Belle is the most beautiful girl in the village
That makes her the best

(LEFOU, spoken)
But she's so... well-read
And you're so... athletically inclined

(GASTON, spoken)
Yes... But ever since the war, I've felt like I've been missing something. And she's the only girl that gives me that sense of

(LEFOU, spoken)
Mmm... je ne sais quoi?

(GASTON, spoken)
I don't know what that means

sung:
Right from the moment when I met her, saw her
I said she's gorgeous and I fell
Here in town, there's only she
Who is beautiful as me
So I'm making plans to woo and marry Belle

Look there he goes
Isn't he dreamy?
Monsieur Gaston
Oh, he's so cute
Be still, my heart
I'm hardly breathing
He's such a tall, dark, strong and handsome brute

Bonjour

Pardon

Good day

Mais oui

You call this bacon?

What lovely flowers

Some cheese

Ten yards

One pound

I'll get the knife

There must be more than this provincial life

(Gaston)
Just watch, I'm going to make Belle my wife

(Ensemble)
Look there she goes
That girl is strange but special
A most peculiar mademoiselle

It's a pity and a sin
She doesn't quite fit in
'Cause she really is a funny girl
A beauty but a funny girl
She really is a funny girl
That Belle"
Ariana Grande,Beauty and the Beast,"Tale as old as time
True as it can be
Barely even friends
Then somebody bends
Unexpectedly

Just a little change
Small to say the least
Both a little scared
Neither one prepared
Beauty and the Beast

Ever just the same
Ever a surprise
Ever as before
And ever just as sure
As the sun will rise

Ever just the same
And ever a surprise
Ever as before
And ever just as sure
As the sun will rise

Tale as old as time
Tune as old as song
Bitter-sweet and strange
Finding you can change
Learning you were wrong

Certain as the sun
Certain as the sun
Rising in the east
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the Beast

Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the Beast

Beauty and...
Beauty and the Beast"
Céline Dion,It's All Coming Back to Me Now,"There were nights when the wind was so cold
That my body froze in bed
If I just listened to it right outside the window
There were days when the sun was so cruel
That all the tears turned to dust
And I just knew my eyes were drying up forever

I finished crying in the instant that you left
And I can't remember when, no way, no how
And I banished every memory you and I had ever made

But when you touch me like this
And you hold me like that
I just have to admit
That it's all coming back to me
When I touch you like this
And I hold you like that
It's so hard to believe
But it's all coming back to me

It's all coming back
It's all coming back to me now
There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things I'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than any laws allowed 
Baby, baby

If I kiss you like this
And if you whisper like that
It was lost long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you want me like this
And if you need me like that
It was dead long ago
But it's all coming back to me
It's so hard to resist
And it's all coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now!

But it's all coming back

There were those empty threats and hollow lies
And whenever you tried to hurt me
I just hurt you even worse and so much deeper
There were hours that just went on for days
When alone at last we'd count up all the chances
That were lost to us forever

But you were history with the slamming of the door
And I made myself so strong again somehow
And I never wasted any of my time on you since then

But if I touch you like this
And if you kiss me like that
It was so long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you touch me like this
And if I kiss you like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me

It's all coming back
It's all coming back to me now
There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things we'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than all your laws allowed
Baby, baby, baby

When you touch me like this
And when you hold me like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this
And when I see you like that
Then we see what we want
To see all coming back to me
The flesh and the fantasies
All coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now!

If you forgive me all this
If I forgive you all that
We forgive and forget
And it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this
And when I see you like that
We see just what we want
To see all coming back to me
The flesh and the fantasies
All coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me...
Now

(It's all coming back to me now)
And when you kiss me like this
(It's all coming back to me now)
And when I touch you like that

If you do it like this

Céline Dion,How Does A Moment Last Forever,"How does a moment last forever?
How can a story never die?
It is love we must hold onto
Never easy, but we try
Sometimes our happiness is captured
Somehow, our time and place stand still
Love lives on inside our hearts and always will

Minutes turn to hours, days to years and gone
But when all else has been forgotten
Still our song lives on

Maybe some moments weren't so perfect
Maybe some memories not so sweet
But we have to know some bad times
Or are lives are incomplete
Then when the shadows overtake us
Just when we feel all hope is gone
We'll hear our song and know once more
Our love lives on

How does a moment last forever?
How does our happiness endure?
Through the darkest of our troubles
Love is beauty, love is pure
Love pays no mind to desolation
It flows like a river through the soul
Protects, persists, and perseveres
And makes us whole

Minutes turn to hours, days to years then gone
But when all else has been forgotten
Still our song lives on
That's how a moment lasts forever:
When our song lives on"
Céline Dion,The Power of Love,"The whispers in the morning
Of lovers sleeping tight
Are rolling by like thunder now
As I look in your eyes

I hold on to your body
And feel each move you make
Your voice is warm and tender
A love that I could not forsake

'Cause I'm your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

Lost is how I'm feeling
Lying in your arms
When the world outside's too much to take
That all ends when I'm with you

Even though there may be times
It seems I'm far away
Never wonder where I am
'Cause I am always by your side

'Cause I'm your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened but I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love

The sound of your heart beating
Made it clear suddenly
The feeling that I can't go on
Is light years away

'Cause I'm your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'm gonna do all that I can

We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened but I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love

The power of love
The power of love
Sometimes I am frightened but I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love

The power of love
Ooh, ooh, ooh
'Cause I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love"
Céline Dion,All By Myself,"When I was young
I never needed anyone
And making love was just for fun
Those days are gone

Livin' alone
I think of all the friends I've known
When I dial the telephone
Nobody's home

All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself anymore

Hard to be sure
Sometimes I feel so insecure
And love's so distant and obscure
Remains the cure

All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself anymore
All by myself
Don't wanna live
All by myself anymore

When I was young
I never needed anyone
Making love was just for fun
Those days are gone

All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself anymore, oh, oh

All by myself
Don't wanna live
Oh, oh, oh
Don't wanna live by myself, by myself anymore, oh
By myself anymore
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, all by myself
Don't wanna live
I never, never, never needed anyone"
Céline Dion,Loved Me Back to Life,"I was walking dead stuck inside my head
I couldn't get out
Turn the lights down
The voices inside were so loud

Need a jump-start, catatonia
I couldn't feel,
I wish that I could disappear
The voices inside were so real

But you stood by my side.
Night after night, night after night.
You loved me back to life, life
From the coma,
The wait is over.
You loved me back to life, life
From the coma,
We're lovers again tonight.

Back to life, back to life, back to life, back to life, yeah

You woke me up, one touch and I felt alive
You loved me back to life, back to life, thought I died.
The voices inside were so quiet.

But you stood by my side
Night after night, night after night
You loved me back to life, life
From the coma,
The wait is over.
You loved me back to life, life
From the coma,
We're lovers again tonight.

Strong hand, thick skin and an open heart
You saw through the pain, saw through the mask
You never gave up on me, yeah

You loved me back to life, life
From the coma,
The wait is over.
You loved me back to life, life
From the coma,
We're lovers again tonight
Back to life, back to life, back to life, back to life
Back to life. back to life, back to life, back to life

Meghan Trainor,Just a Friend to You,"Why you gotta hug me
Like that every time you see me?
Why you always making me laugh
Swear you're catching feelings

I loved you from the start
So it breaks my heart

When you say I'm just a friend to you
'Cause friends don't do the things we do
Everybody knows you love me too
Tryna be careful with the words I use
I say it 'cause I'm dying to
I'm so much more than just a friend to you

When there's other people around
You never wanna kiss me
You tell me it's too late to hang out
And you say you miss me

And I loved you from the start
So it breaks my heart

When you say I'm just a friend to you
'Cause friends don't do the things we do
Everybody knows you love me too
Tryna be careful with the words I use
I say it 'cause I'm dying to
I'm so much more than just a friend to you

You...

You say I'm just a friend to you
Friends don't do the things we do
Everybody knows you love me too

I say it 'cause I'm dying to
I'm so much more than just a friend to you

A friend to you
A friend to you
A friend to you"
Ed Sheeran,Sunburn,"You're not her
Though I try to see you differently
I tow the line
See, I'm searching for what used to be mine

I saw your eyes and then I saw Alice staring back at me
And I will try to find another one who's suited to me
As well as her

I've moved far away from you and I want to see you here
Beside me, dear, but things aren't clear

When we never even tried, we never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful, whenever I was away
I'd miss you
I miss you

She was mine, I was hers and all that's in between
When she would cry, I would shelter her and keep her
From the darkness that will be

If I moved far away from you and I want to see you here
Beside me, dear, but things aren't clear, woah

When we never even tried, we never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful, whenever I was away
I'd miss you
And I miss you

Don't drop me in, it's not my turn
If you cut deep then I might learn
If you scar and leave me like sunburn

Don't drop me in, it's not my time
If you cut deep then I might learn
You scarred and left me, like sunburn

When we never even tried, we never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful, whenever I was away
I'd miss you
And I miss you"
Endah N Rhesa,When You Love Someone,"I love you but it's not so easy to make you here with me
I wanna touch and hold you forever
But you're still in my dream

And I can't stand to wait till night is coming to my life
But I still have a time to break a silence
When you love someone
Just be brave to say that you want him to be with you

When you hold your love
Don't ever let it go
Or you will loose your chance
To make your dreams come true...

I used to hide and watch you from a distance and I knew you realized
I was looking for a time to get closer at least to say... ""hello""
And I can't stand to wait your love is coming to my life
When you love someone
Just be brave to say that you want him to be with you

When you hold your love
Don't ever let it go
Or you will loose your chance
To make your dreams come true...

And I never thought that I'm so strong
I stuck on you and wait so long
But when love comes it can't be wrong
Don't ever give up just try and try to get what you want
Cause love will find the way...
When you love someone
Just be brave to say that you want him to be with you

When you hold your love
Don't ever let it go
Or you will loose your chance
To make your dreams come true..."
911,I Do,"My whole world changed from the moment I met you
And it would never be the same
Felt like I knew that I always loved you
From the moment I heard your name

Everything was perfect, I knew this love was worth it
Our own miracle in the making
And till this world stops turning
I'll still be here waiting and waiting to make that vow that I'll...

I'll be by your side
Till the day I die
I'll be waiting till I hear you say I do
Something old, something new
Something borrowed, something blue
I'll be waiting till I hear you say I do

Smiles by the thousands, your tears have all dried out
'Cause I won't see you cry again
Throw pennies in a fountain, look at what comes out
Sometimes wishes do come true

Now everything was perfect, I know this love was worth it
Our own miracle in the making
And till this world stops turning
I'll still be here waiting and waiting to make that vow that I'll...

Always better than worse, protect you from the hurt
I'll be waiting till I hear you say I do
I do love you, yes I do love you
I'll be waiting till I hear you say I do
'Cause I love you, love you

I'll be by your side
Till the day I die
I'll be waiting till I hear you say I do
Something old, something new
Something borrowed, something blue
I'll be waiting till I hear you say I do

We're shining like a diamond, just look at us now
I wanna hear you say I do"

Uh, uh huh
So what I keep 'em rolled up
Saggin' my pants not caring what I show
Keep it real with my niggas
Keep it player for the hoes
And look clean don't it?
Washed it the other day, watch how you lean on it
Give me some 501's jeans on and roll joints bigger than King Kong's fingers
And smoke them hoes down till they stingers

Find how to turn things around

From the ground up, pound up, this Taylor Gang
So turn my sound up and mount up and do my thing

Got my own car, no job, no children
Had a science project, me and Mac killed it

Gym Class Heroes,Stereo Hearts (feat. Adam Levine),"My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-o-ote

Make me your radio (yeah, a-ha)
And turn me up when you feel low (turn it up a little bit)
This melody was meant for you (uh... like that)
So sing along to my stereo
(Gym Class Heroes baby!)

If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?
If I ask you to scratch my back, could you manage that?
Like get Rihanna, chicka, Travie, I can handle that

Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to, used to, used to, used to, now I'm over that
'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts

If I could only find a note to make you understand
I'd sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand
Keep me stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my heart is a stereo that only plays for you
Heh heh heh

My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-o-ote (Yeah, yeah, yeah, come on)

Make me your radio (Uh huh)
And turn me up when you feel low (Turn it up)
This melody was meant for you
So sing along to my stereo

Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh, to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh, so sing along to my stereo (Let's go)

If I was an old school fifty-pound boombox ('member them?)
Would you hold me on your shoulder wherever you walk?
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops? (turn it up)
And crank it higher every time they told you to stop?

And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
When you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mixtape your friends make
You never know, we come and go like on the interstate

I think finally found a note to make you understand
If you can hear this, sing along and take me by the hands
Keep me stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my heart is a stereo that only plays for you

My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every note
O-oh

Make me your radio
And turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
So sing along to my stereo

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh, so sing along to my stereo

I only pray you'll never leave me behind (never leave me)
Because good music can be so hard to find (so hard to find)
I'll take your hand and hold it closer to mine (yeah)
Thought love was dead, but now you're changing my mind (yeah, yeah c'mon!)

My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-o-ote (oh, oh)

Make me your radio
And turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
So sing along to my stereo

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh, so sing along to my stereo

It's ya boy Travie
Gym Class Heroes, baby!

So sing along to my stereo

Yeah!"

Clean Bandit,Symphony (feat. Zara Larsson),"I've been hearing symphonies
Before all I heard was silence
A rhapsody for you and me
And every melody is timeless

Life was stringing me along
Then you came and you cut me loose
Was solo singing on my own
Now I can't find the key without you

And now your song is on repeat
And I'm dancin' on to your heartbeat
And when you're gone, I feel incomplete
So if you want the truth

I just wanna be part of your symphony
Will you hold me tight and not let go?
Symphony
Like a love song on the radio
Will you hold me tight and not let go?

I'm sorry if it's all too much
Every day you're here, I'm healing
And I was runnin' out of luck
I never thought I'd find this feeling

'Cause I've been hearing symphonies
Before all I heard was silence
A rhapsody for you and me
(A rhapsody for you and me)
And every melody is timeless

And now your song is on repeat
And I'm dancin' on to your heartbeat
And when you're gone, I feel incomplete
So if you want the truth

Zee Avi,I Am Me Once More,"No...
I really don't think so
That you'd think I'd be incapable
Of being on my own

No...
I really don't think so
That I would for a second let you
Back in through my door

I have spent
Many a-nights even when
You were by my side
I shed tears I couldn't dry

But I should thank you for
Taking my blindfold off
Now I ain't jaded no more
And I take pride
In bein' the one that said goodbye
That could only mean
I am me, once more

You would turn
Your head the other way
So you won't have to listen
To what I had to say

You assumed
That I needed you
But you didn't realize that
I needed no one but myself

But I should thank you for
Taking my blindfold off
Now I ain't jaded no more
And I take pride
In bein' the one that said goodbye
That could only mean
I am me, once more"
Akon,Smack That,"(Shady)

Akon
Convict, up front
Akon, Slim Shady
I see the one
Could she be that lady

I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it, like Taebo
And possibly bend you over

Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, till you get sore
Smack that, oh oh oh

Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, till you get sore
Smack that, oh oh oh

Up front style, ready to attack now
Pull in the parking lot slow with the 'lac down
Convicts got the whole thing packed down
Step in the club, the wardrobe intact now

(I feel it) Go on and crack now
(Oh, I see it) Don't let back now
(I'm-a call her) Then I put the mack down
(Money? No problem) Pocket full of that now

I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it, like Taebo
And possibly bend you over

Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, till you get sore
Smack that, oh oh oh

Smack that, all on the floor

Eminem
Oh, looks like another club banger
They better hang on when I throw this thang on
Get a little drink on, they goin' flip
For this Akon shit, you can bank on it

Pedicure, manicure, kitty cat claws
The way she climbs up and down them poles
Lookin' like one of them Pretty Cat Dolls
Try'na hold my woody back through my drawers

Steps off stage, didn't think I saw her
Creeps up behind me and she's like, you're
I'm like, I know, let's cut to the chase
No time to waste, back to my place

Plus from the club to the crib's like a mile away
Or more like a palace, shall I say
And plus I got a pal, every gal is game
In fact he's the one singing the song that's playing! (Akon!)

Akon

Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo

Eminem,Rap God,"Look, I was gonna go easy on you, not to hurt your feelings
But I'm only going to get this one chance
Something's wrong, I can feel it (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)
Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble – big trouble
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances
You are just what the doc ordered

I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slapbox, slapbox?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rapbot

But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit

Made a living and a killing off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nut-sack
I'm an MC still as honest

But as rude and indecent as all hell
Syllables skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This slickety-gippety-hippity-hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissing match with this rappity-rap
Packing a MAC in the back of the Ac, backpack rap, yap-yap, yacketty-yack

And now at the exact same time
I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half

Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs, feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are having a rough time period, here's a maxi-pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece, yeah

'Cause I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slapbox, slapbox?
Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard

Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the earth like an asteroid, I did nothing but shoot for the moon since
*pew*

MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to bust a rhyme
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N-
-W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim

Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up, and be in a position
To meet Run-D.M.C. and induct them into the motherfuckin' Rock n'
Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game till I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?
Little gay looking boy

So gay I can barely say it with a straight face looking boy
You witnessing a massacre
Like you watching a church gathering take place looking boy
Oy vey, that boy's gay, that's all they say looking boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a way to go from your label everyday looking boy
Hey, looking boy, what you say looking boy?
I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre looking boy
I'mma work for everything I have
Never asked nobody for shit, get out my face looking boy
Basically boy you're never gonna be capable
Of keeping up with the same pace looking boy

'Cause I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racing around the track, call me Nascar, Nascar
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton, no Asgard, Asgard

So you be Thor and I'll be Odin, you rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off then I'm reloading immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walking dead, but I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating
But I got your mom deep throating

I'm out my Ramen noodle, we have nothing in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though

For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
Enough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground, but I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind

So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come trying to censor you
Like that one line I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP
One where I tried to say I'd take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm

Morphin' into an immortal coming through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows
You write normal, fuck being normal
And I just bought a new raygun from the future

To just come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Maywhether’s pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh, man, that was the 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day
""Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you""
Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed, JJ Fad

Uh, sama lamaa duma lamaa you assuming I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber
So that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
Oh, he's too mainstream
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
It's not hip-hop, it's pop, 'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it

I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I’m ripping any one of these verses diverse as you
It’s curtains, I’m inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to prove
That if you were half as nice, your songs and you could sacrifice virgins too

School flunky, pill junky
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues
But it's still tongue and cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel, I'm asleep in the front seat
Bumping Heavy D. & The Boyz, still chunky, but funky
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me

They asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I had
Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation
Understand the discrimination

But fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then
But if I can't batter the women how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake it for Satan
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas
And take a vacation to trip a broad
And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard
Be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a God?"
Eminem,When I'm Gone,"Yeah
It's my life
My own words I guess

Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart
And you know you were their armor

And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm 'em
But what happens when karma turns right around and bites you
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of a pain?
""Daddy, look what I made."", dad's gotta go catch a plane

""Daddy, where's mommy? I can't find mommy, where is she?""
I don't know go play Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writing this song, this song ain't gonna write itself
I'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself

Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back

I keep having this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing
""You're making mommy cry, why? Why is mommy crying?""
Baby, daddy ain't leaving no more, ""Daddy you're lying,
You always say that, you always say this is the last time.
But you ain't leaving no more, daddy you're mine.""

She's pilling boxes in front of the door trying to block it
""Daddy please, daddy don't leave, daddy - no stop it!""
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, ""This'll keep you safe daddy, take it with ya.""

I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talking, 'cause man I can hear 'em
They're saying ""You've got one more chance to do right,"" and it's tonight
Now go out there and show that you love 'em before it's too late
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on
And I'm singing

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back

60,000 people, all jumping out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet
I take a bow and thank you all for coming out
They're screaming so loud, I take one last look at the crowd

I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seeing
""Daddy it's me, help mommy, her wrists are bleeding,""
But baby we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
""I followed you daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'

""You lied to me Dad, and now you make mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'.
That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin.
I get the point - fine, me and mommy are gone.""

But baby wait, ""It's too late dad, you made the choice.
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us.""
That's what they want, they want you Marshall, they keep screamin' your name
It's no wonder you can't go to sleep, just take another pill
Yeah, I bet you you will. You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real

I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be, that the curtain is closing on me
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain and scream ""Die Shady!"" and pop it

The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's Spring and Hailie's outside swinging, I walk right up to Kim and kiss her
Tell her I miss her, Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister
Almost as if to say

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back"
Eminem,Without Me,"Obie Trice:
Obie Trice - real name, no gimmicks.

Eminem:
Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside
'Round the outside, 'round the outside
Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside
'Round the outside, 'round the outside

Guess who's back, back, back?
Back again, gain, gain
Shady's back, back, back
Tell a friend

Guess who's back, guess who's back?
Guess who's back, guess who's back?
Guess who's back, guess who's back?
Guess who's back, la, la, la

I've created a monster, 'cause nobody wants to
See Marshall no more they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor

Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
Then a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not cooperating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (hey)

You waited this long to stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating

So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me so let me see
They tried to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me

So, come on dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, ""Fuck you Debbie""

Now this looks a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners, helpless
Till someone comes along on a mission and yells ""bitch""

A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the air waves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass

And it's a disaster such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass, you ask for me?
Well I'm back - na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in and then I'm gonna enter in it

Up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kids ears and nesting

""Testing, attention please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my 10 cents, my 2 cents is free
A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me?

Now this looks a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

A tisk-it a task-it, I'll go tit for tat wit'
Anybody who's talking this shit, that shit
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards

And Moby, you can get stomped by Obie
You 36-year-old bald-headed fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno

Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol

But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me I'm just obscene (hey)

Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (hey)

There's a concept that works
20 million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'll be so empty without me

Now this looks a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me

Coldplay,The Scientist,"Come up to meet you
Tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are

I had to find you
Tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart

Tell me your secrets
And ask me your questions
Oh let's go back to the start

Running in circles
Coming up tails
Heads on a science apart

Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard

Oh take me back to the start

I was just guessing
At numbers and figures
Pulling your puzzles apart

Questions of science
Science and progress
Could not speak as loud as my heart

Tell me you love me
Come back and haunt me
Oh when I rush to the start

Running in circles
Chasing tails
Coming back as we are

Nobody said it was easy
Oh it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard

I'm going back to the start"
David Archuleta,Numb,"I think I'll take a second chance
I won't be passing by these waters again
Wanna feel redemption's hand
And see this life only for what it is
I know the river's not too wide
Had to see it for myself with my own eyes
Someone out there's on my side
It's not my place to question why

Everybody needs time away
To wake up with the sun on their face
I'm not there yet but I know

That I don't wanna feel numb
Falling over all of my shadows
Yeah I'm all done
'Cause none of that ever really mattered
It hurts to live so wide awake, oh
But it's a chance I can take
I won't run run run
'Cause I don't wanna feel numb

So deep inside these hills I run
To a place where I can see till kingdom come
See the days one by one
And love this life only for what it, what it is
I hear the whispers in the stars
The words that tell us more of who we are
Someone out there's not that far
Everything I need is here now

Everybody needs time away
To wake up with the sun on their face
I'm not there yet but I know

That I don't wanna feel numb
Falling over all of my shadows
Yeah I'm all done
'Cause none of that ever really mattered
It hurts to live so wide awake, oh
But it's a chance I can take
I won't run run run
'Cause I don't wanna feel numb

A tidal wave brought to life
Rushing over every doubt of mine
Open soul in an open sky
Everything, everything is right

I don't wanna feel numb
Falling over all of my shadows
Yeah I'm all done
'Cause none of that ever really mattered
It hurts to live so wide awake, oh
But it's a chance I can take
I won't run run run, yeah
And no, I won't run run run

'Cause I don't wanna feel numb
'Cause I don't wanna feel numb"

But these days I don't even know myself, no
I always thought I'd be with someone else
I thought I would own the way I felt, yeah

I call you but you never even answer
I tell myself I'm done with wicked games
But then I get so numb with all the laughter
That I forget about the pain

Whoa, you stress me out, you kill me
You drag me down, you fuck me up
We're on the ground, we're screaming

I love it, I hate it, and I can't take it
But I keep on coming back to you

I know my friends, they give me bad advice

Linkin Park,Final Masquerade,"Tearing me apart with words you wouldn't say
And suddenly tomorrow's a moment washed away
'Cause I don't have a reason and you don't have the time
But we both keep on waiting for something we won't find

The light on the horizon was brighter yesterday
With shadows floating over, the scars begin to fade
We said it was forever, but then it slipped away
Standing at the end of the final masquerade
The final masquerade

All I ever wanted, the secrets that you keep
All you ever wanted, the truth I couldn't speak
'Cause I can't see forgiveness and you can't see the crime
And we both keep on waiting for what we left behind

The light on the horizon was brighter yesterday
With shadows floating over, the scars begin to fade
We said it was forever, but then it slipped away
Standing at the end of the final masquerade
The final masquerade
The final masquerade
Standing at the end of the final masquerade

The light on the horizon was brighter yesterday

Linkin Park,Until It's Gone,"A fire needs a space to burn, a breath to build a glow
I've heard it said a thousand times, but now I know

That you don't know what you've got 
Oh, you don't know what you've got
No, you don't know what you've got until it's gone
Until it's gone
Until it's gone

I thought I kept you safe and sound, I thought I made you strong
But something made me realize that I was wrong
'Cause finding what you've got sometimes means finding it alone
And I can finally see your light when I let go

'Cause you don't know what you've got till it's gone
Until it's gone
Until it's gone

Until it's gone
Until it's gone
Until it's gone
Until it's gone
Until it's gone

Oh, you don't know what you've got

Linkin Park,Guilty All The Same (feat. Rakim),"Tell us all again what you think we should be
What the answers are, what it is we can't see
Tell us all again, how to do what you say
How to fall in line, how there's no other way

But oh, we all know

You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
You're guilty all the same

Show us all again that our hands are unclean
That we're unprepared, that you have what we need
Show us all again, 'cause we cannot be saved
'Cause the end is near, now there's no other way

And oh, you will know

You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
There's no one else to blame

Guilty all the same
Guilty all the same
You're guilty all the same

Yeah, you already know what it is
Can y'all explain, what kind of land is this
When a man has plans of being rich?
But the bosses' plans is wealthy?
Dirty money scheme
A clean split is nonsense
It's insane, even corporate hands is filthy

They talk team and take the paper route
All they think about is bank accounts
Assets and realty at anybody's expense
No shame with a clear conscience
No regrets and guilt free
They claim that ain't the way that they built me
The smokescreen, before the flame
Knowing as soon as the dough or deal peak
They say it's time for things to change
Rearrange like good product rebuilt cheap
Anything if it's more to gain
Drained, manipulated like artists, its real deep
Until no more remains

But I'm still me
Like authentic hip-hop and rock
'Til pop and radio, and record companies killed me
Try to force me to stray and obey
They got the gall to say how real can real be?

You feel me? We'll see
The green could be to blame
Or greedy for the fame, TV or a name
The media, the game
To me you're all the same
You're guilty

You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
You're guilty all the same
Guilty all the same
Guilty all the same
Guilty all the same"
Linkin Park,One Step Closer,"I cannot take this anymore
Saying everything I've said before
All these words, they make no sense
I found bliss in ignorance
Less I hear the less you say
You'll find that out anyway

Just like before

Everything you say to me
(Takes me one step closer to the edge and I'm about to break)
I need a little room to breathe
('Cause I'm one step closer to the edge, I'm about to break)

I find the answers aren't so clear
Wish I could find a way to disappear
All these thoughts, they make no sense
I found bliss in ignorance
Nothing seems to go away
Over and over again

Linkin Park,Bleed It Out,"Yeah, here we go for the hundredth time
Hand grenade pins in every line
Throw 'em up and let something shine
Going out of my fucking mind
Filthy mouth, no excuse
Find a new place to hang this noose
String me up from atop these roofs
Knot it tight so I won't get loose
Truth is, you can stop and stare
Bled myself out and no one cares
Dug the trench out, laid down there
With a shovel up out of reach somewhere
Yeah, someone pour it in
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away
I bleed it out

Go, stop the show
Choppy words and a sloppy flow
Shotgun opera, lock and load
Cock it back and then watch it go
Mama help me, I've been cursed
Death is rolling in every verse
Candy paint on his brand new hearse
Can't contain him, he knows he works
Fuck this hurts, I won't lie
Doesn't matter how hard I try
Half the words don't mean a thing
And I know that I won't be satisfied
So why try ignoring him?
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away
I bleed it out

I've opened up these scars
I'll make you face this
I pulled myself so far
I'll make you face this loud

I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away

I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away

Lauv,The Other,"Like a spotlight the water hits me
Ran it extra cold to shake the words from my mouth
Though I know that no one's listening
I nervously rehearsed for when you're around
And I keep waiting like you might change my mind

Who wrote the book on goodbye?
There's never been a way to make this easy
When there's nothing quite wrong but it don't feel right
Either your head or your heart, you set the other on fire

Back and forth now I'm feelin' guilty
'Cause I just can't stop this pendulum in my head
Though I know that our time is ending
I'd rather lay forever right in this bed

And I keep waiting like, you might change my mind
Give me one more night

Who wrote the book on goodbye?
There's never been a way to make this easy
When there's nothing quite wrong but it don't feel right
Either your head or your heart, you set the other on fire

No one knows, knows, knows. No one knows, knows, knows

We fell from the peak
And the stars, they broke their code
I'm trying to forget
How I landed on this road
I'm caught in between
What I wish and what I know
When they say that you just know

Who wrote the book on goodbye?
There's never been a way to make this easy
When there's nothing quite wrong but it don't feel right
Either your head or your heart, you set the other on fire

No one knows, knows, knows. No one knows, knows, knows

You set the other on fire. You set the other on fire"

ZAYN,fOoL fOr YoU,"This love is tainted
I need you and I hate it
You're caught between a dream and a movie scene
In a way, you know what I mean
When the darts just miss, I just can't resist it

'Cause I'm a fool for you and the things you do
'Cause I'm a fool for you and the things, the things you do
The things you do, the things you do

When you're looking like this
I just can't resist it
I know sometimes I hide it
But I can't this time 'cause it's gonna defeat me
But if you won't believe me, believe me

'Cause I'm a fool for you and the things you do
'Cause I'm a fool for you and the things, the things you do
The things you do, the things you do

I know, I know given a chance I'd do it again
'Cause I can't help myself
'Cause I can't stop myself
I just love being a fool for you

The Wanted,Could This Be Love,"Max:
She takes my breath away
She's got me calling everyday
I can't seem to get enough
Could this be love?

Stay up 'til late at night
Watch the stars burst into light
Watch movies all the time
We can't get enough

Jay:
I'd jump out of a plane
Write your name in the sky
You're shaking my life up

All:
Could this be love?
I'm feeling drifting up
On ceilings with your touch
Could this be love, love, love?

Could stay awake all night long
Could this be love?

Sky is clear, the stars are bright
I kiss her lips and hold her tight
Is that enough?

Let's take a chance on this time
Could be the best of our lives
I think we already know

You know I'm always right by your side
See I've never felt this love
You're the only thing that's on my mind

You don't understand how much you really mean to me

Mike Posner,I Took A Pill In Ibiza,"I took a pill in Ibiza
To show Avicii I was cool
And when I finally got sober, felt 10 years older
But fuck it, it was something to do
I'm living out in LA
I drive a sports car just to prove
I'm a real big baller 'cause I made a million dollars
And I spend it on girls and shoes

But you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs

I'm just a singer who already blew his shot
I get along with old timers
'Cause my name's a reminder of a pop song people forgot
And I can't keep a girl, no
'Cause as soon as the sun comes up
I cut 'em all loose and work's my excuse
But the truth is I can't open up

But you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs

I took a plane to my home town
I brought my pride and my guitar
All my friends are all gone but there's manicured lawns
And the people still think I'm a star
I walked around downtown
I met some fans on Lafayette
They said ""tell us how to make it 'cause we're getting real impatient""
So I looked 'em in the eye and said

You don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All that I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all that I know are sad songs, sad songs"

Was it all in my fantasy?
Where are you now?
Were you only imaginary?

Where are you now?
Atlantis
Under the sea, under the sea
Where are you now?
Another dream
The monster's running wild inside of me

I'm faded
I'm faded
I'm faded
I'm faded
So lost

You're watching me, watching me, watching me go
But I never listen
No, I'll never let you know

Now we're heading uptown
Is there something or nothing you wanted to say
'Cause I need to go now
Do you want me to stay? (Stay)

What you need to know,
Is you tried to let it go, let it go
What you need to find,
Is someone who will never let you go
No! And sunshine and city lights will guide you home
Oh, and you gotta know
That I'll never let you go

Now we're stuck in midtown
Surrounded by people and nothing but sound
And we're going nowhere
And we're the lost and found

We are all over this town

Do you want me to go now?
'Cause baby, I wanna stay, oh, stay

Sabrina Carpenter,Can't Blame a Girl for Trying,"Here I am again, the same old situation
Why does the guy thing have to be so complicated?
I should have played it cool, instead I made a fool
Oh, the things I do

'Cause I'm young and I'm dumb
I do stupid things when it comes to love
And even if I always end up crying
Well, you can't blame a girl for trying
Oh oh, oh oh
No, you can't blame a girl for trying
Ooh ooh

I should've shut my mouth, I could've kept it quiet
I might have freaked him out 'cause I was so excited
But I just couldn't wait, I took a leap of faith
Oh, the things I say

'Cause I'm young and I'm dumb
I do stupid things when it comes to love
And even if I always end up crying
Well, you can't blame a girl for trying
Oh oh, oh oh
No, you can't blame a girl for trying
Oh oh, no, no

And I think sometimes
I tend to be my own worst enemy
And maybe someday
I'm gonna catch a shooting star falling out of the blue
Doing what I do

And just as I'm giving up, my heart is palpitating
Here comes another one, it's so intoxicating
And being where I've been, I know that in the end
I'll do it all again

'Cause I'm young and I'm dumb
I do stupid things when it comes to love
And even if I always end up crying
Well, love will find me, there ain't no denying
That you can't blame a girl for trying
Oh oh, oh oh
No, you can't blame a girl for trying
Mmm, oh"
Sabrina Carpenter,Eyes Wide Open,"La di da da da na
Yeah

Everybody loves to tell me
I was born an old soul
Better keep my eyes wide open
There's so much that I don't know
Just another hotel room
Never felt so all alone
I think about my granddad's eyes
And they always send me home
I can almost hear him now
I gotta make him proud

I keep my eyes wide open
Bless this ground, unbroken
I'm about to make my way
Heaven help me keep my faith
And my eyes wide open

I can't see two steps ahead of me
When the fog comes rollin' in
I never thought I'd miss the rain
Lord knows how long it's been
This dream burns inside of me
And I can't just let it go
There's still so much that I don't know

I keep my eyes wide open
Bless this ground, unbroken
I'm about to make my way
Heaven help me keep my faith
And my eyes wide open

All I have is just this moment
And I don't wanna miss a second
'Cause it could all be gone in an instant
Yeah, in an instant

I keep my eyes wide open
Bless this ground, unbroken
I'm about to make my way
Heaven help me keep my faith
And my eyes wide open

I'm about to make my way
Heaven help me keep my faith
My eyes wide open

Keep my eyes wide open"

French Montana,Unforgettable,"It's not good enough for me, since I been with you
It's not gonna work for you, nobody can equal me, I know
I'm gonna sip on this drink, when I'm fucked up
I should know how to pick up
I'm gonna catch the rhythm while she push up against me
Ooh, is she tipsy?
I had enough convo for twenty four
I peep'd you from across the room
Pretty little body, dancing like GoGo

But you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone, why not?
A fucking good time, never hurt nobody
I got a little drink but it's not Bacardi
If you loved your girl then I'm so, so sorry
I got to give it to her like we in a marriage
Oh, like we in a hurry
No, no I won't tell nobody
You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers do

Feelin' like I'm fresh out; Boosie
If they want the drama, got the Uzi
Ship the whole crew to the cruise ship
Doin' shit you don't even see in movies
Ride with me, ride with me, boss
I got a hard head but her ass soft
She want the last name with the ring on it
'Cause I pulled out a million cash, told her plank on it

You are unforgettable
I need to get you alone
Now you wanna choose
Just pop the bubbly in the 'cuzi

It's not good enough for me, since I been with you
It's not gonna work for you, nobody can equal me, I know
I'm gonna sip on this drink, when I'm fucked up
I should know how to pick up
I'm gonna catch the rhythm while she push up against me
Ooh, is she tipsy?
I had enough convo for twenty four
I peep'd you from across the room
Pretty little body, dancing like GoGo

But you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone
Why not?
A fucking good time, never hurt nobody
I got a little drink but it's not gonna party
If you loved your girl then I'm so, so sorry
I got to give it to her like we in a marriage
Oh, like we in a hurry
No, no I won't tell nobody
You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers do

You ain't enough for me
Too much for you alone
Baby go and grab some bad bitches
Bring 'em home

Know the jet's on me
I'ma curve my best for you
You don't know, so pick up that dress for me
Leave the rest on

Too much convo for twenty four hours
When you stand next to twenty four karats
She left her man at home
She don't love him no more

I want your mind and your body
Don't mind nobody
So as long you never hurt nobody
Baby girl work your body
Work your body

You are unforgettable
I need to get you alone
Now you wanna choose
Just pop the bubbly in the 'cuzi

Oh, like we in a hurry
No, no I won't tell nobody
You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers do"
Machine Gun Kelly,At My Best (feat. Hailee Steinfeld),"Turn my vocals up, alright

I wrote this song as a message for help
On behalf of anybody finding their-self
I wrote this letter to numb your pain
'Cause everyday I wake up I'm feeling the same
I got issues just like you got issues
I been hurt, I seen the scar tissue
If I show you would you run away
Do I gotta hide 'em for you to wanna stay
Do I, even need you, should I leave you
Do I, gotta be you, just to please you
Do I, say I'm all good, when I bleed you
Through my, heart, quit tearing mine apart

I shout, I swear, I get angry, I get scared
I fall, I break, I mess up, I make mistakes
But if you can't take me at my worst
You don't deserve me at my best

Got to keep it going, got to keep my head up, uh
Got to keep it going, got to keep my head up, uh
Got to keep it going, got to keep my head up 'cause life is about, aight check this out

Life is about making mistakes
It's also about trying to be great
Do not let failure scare you away
I know you fed up, you fall, get up
It's all in us, I can speak about 'cause I did it (true)
Ladies and gentlemen here's the exhibit
It's my life look a little closer you could see the highlight
Gold ain't always golden but I told 'em
Look at all the years I've been waiting for a moment
Shed a lot of tears just to smile in the morning
Tell me could you love me, tell me could you love me
Tell me could you love me if I told you why

I shout, I swear, I get angry, I get scared
I fall, I break, I mess up, I make mistakes
But if you can't take me at my worst
You don't deserve me at my best

This song's for anybody, yeah
Who feels like I did
Never the cool kid
This song's for anybody
Who fought their way through
Always remain true
This song's for anybody
The one's who trying to get it
The one's who dream it and live it
This song's for anybody
This song, this song, this song, this song, this song, this song

I shout, I swear, I get angry, I get scared
I fall, I break, I mess up, I make mistakes
But if you can't take me at my worst
You don't deserve me at my best

Got to keep it going, got to keep my head up, uh
Got to keep it going, got to keep my head up, uh
Got to keep it going, got to keep my head up 'cause life is about"
Logic,Everybody,"Okay I was gone for a minute but I'm back now
Sit the fuck back down

Oh it's like that now?
I'ma show you mothafuckas how to act now
I'ma show 'em how to act
I'ma show 'em how to act

Okay now picture little Bobby just a youngin' runnin' round
With his man's, hammer in his hands, feelin' like the man
Run, mothafucka, run
Before the popo get the gun, put it to your brain like goddamn!
Everybody know you ain't about it
Everything you talk about I know I can live without it
Red light, stop. Green light, go!
Everything ain't what it seem like
Mothafucka I know!
Hold up, what you mean, where you been?
Bitch I been in
This is merely the beginning again
What you been living in?
A box, under the bridge, like Anthony Kiedis?
Looking for something to complete us
And maybe lead us, fuck an elitist
Hell of a long way from equal is how they treat us
Body of a builder with the mind of a fetus
Turn on the television and see the vision they feed us
And I wish I could erase that, face facts

Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something
Everybody love, everybody know, how it go
Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something
Everybody love, everybody know

I been knockin' doors down like a Jehovah witness
God as my witness, I'm with this
But on the real I think I need another witness!
If it was, black daddy, white momma wouldn't change a thing
Light skin mothafucka certified as a house nigga
Well I'll be God damned, go figure
In my blood is the slave and the master
It's like the devil playin' spades with the pastor
But he was born with the white privilege!
Man what the fuck is that?
White people told me as a child, as a little boy, playin' with his toys
I should be ashamed to be black
And some black people look ashamed when I rap
Like my great granddaddy didn't take a whip to the back
Not accepted by the black or the white
I don't give a fuck, praise God, I could see the light
Everybody talkin' 'bout race this, race that
Wish I could erase that, face facts

Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something
Everybody love, everybody know, how it go
Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something
Everybody love, everybody know

Macklemore,Glorious (feat. Skylar Grey),"You know I'm back like I never left (I never left) 
Another sprint, another step (Another step) 
Another day, another breath (Another breath) 
Been chasin' dreams, but I never slept
I got a new attitude and a lease on life 
And some peace of mind
You seek and I find, I can sleep when I die 
Wanna piece of the pie, grab the keys to the ride
And shit, I'm straight
I'm on my wave, I'm on my wave
Get out my wake, I'm running late, what can I say?

I heard you die twice
Once when they bury you in the grave
And the second time is the last time
That somebody mentions your name
So when I leave here on this earth
Did I take more than I gave?
Did I look out for the people
Or did I do it all for fame?
Legend, it's exodus
Searching for euphoria
Trudgin' through the mud to find the present, no ignorin' us
Got twenty thousand deep off in the street like we some warriors 
My mama told me, ""Never bow your head"" (Woo)

I feel glorious, glorious
Got a chance to start again
I was born for this, born for this
It's who I am, how could I forget?
I made it through the darkest part of the night
And now, I see the sunrise 
Now I feel glorious, glorious 
I feel glorious, glorious

I'm feeling glorious
The crib looking Victorian (Oh, yes it is)
You know that we been goin' in (Been goin' in)
Since we hopped out that Delorean (Delorean, yeah we win) 
En garde, things are just things
They don't make you who you are
Can't pack up a U-Haul and take it with you when you're gone 
We posted on the porch, my family's glasses to the stars
My grandma smilin' down on me like, ""Woo, that boy got bars!"" 
Okay, okay, yes I do
I said amen and hallelujah, let me testify too
Another morning, a morning, won't let self get in my way
I got my breath, I got my faith, and I remember why I came, woo!

I feel glorious, glorious
Got a chance to start again
I was born for this, born for this
It's who I am, how could I forget?
I made it through the darkest part of the night And now, I see the sunrise
And now, I see the sunrise
Now I feel glorious, glorious
I feel glorious, glorious

We gon' be alright, put that on my life
When I open my eyes, hope I see you shine 
We're planting our flag, they don't understand 
The world is up for grabs (Hey, hey, hey)

We gon' be alright, put that on my life

Passenger,And I Love Her,"She's a whistle on the wind
Feather on the breeze
Ripple on the stream
She is, sunlight on the sea
She's a soft summer rain
Falling gently trought the trees

And I love her

She's cunning as a fox
Clever as a crow
Solid as a rock
She is, stubborn as a stone
She's a hard-headed woman
And the best one that I know

And I love her
Yeah well, I love her

She's as new as the springtime
Strong as autumn blows
Warm as the summer and,
Soft as the snow
She's a thousand miles from here
But she's everywere I go

'Cause I love her

She loves me like a woman
She looks like a lady
But she laughs like a child
And cries like a baby
I think that maybe,
She's the one that's gonna save me"

The remedy is the experience, this is a dangerous liaison 
I says the comedy is that it's serious
This is a strange enough new play on words 
I said, the tragedy is how you're going to spend

The rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends
Well, it all amounts to nothing 
In the end 

I won't worry my life away
I won't worry my life away

Well I heard two men, talking on the radio 
In a crossfire kind of new reality show
Uncovering the ways to plan the next big attack 
Or they were counting down the ways to stab the brother in the

Be right back after this 
The unavoidable kiss, with a minty fresh death-breath 
Is sure to outlast this catastrophe 
Dance with me

I says the comedy is that it's serious
This is a strange enough new play on words

The rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends
When, it all amounts to nothing 
In the end 

I won't worry my life away 
I won't worry my life away 

When I fall in love
I take my time, there's no need to hurry 
When I'm making up my mind
You can turn off the sun, but I'm still going to shine 
And I'll tell you why

Because the remedy is the experience, this is a dangerous liaison 
I says the comedy is that it's serious
This is a strange enough new play on words 
I said, the tragedy is how you're going to spend

The rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends
When, it all amounts to nothing

Watching you's the only drug I need
You so gangster; I'm so thug
You're the only one I'm dreaming of, you see
I can be myself now, finally
In fact, there's nothing I can't be
I want the world to see you be with me

Hey, soul sister, ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair you know
Hey, soul sister, I don't wanna miss a single thing you do
Tonight

Hey, soul sister, I don't wanna miss a single thing you do
Tonight
Hey, hey, hey
Tonight
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Tonight"
fun.,Some Nights,"Some nights, I stay up cashing in my bad luck
Some nights, I call it a draw
Some nights, I wish that my lips could build a castle
Some nights, I wish they'd just fall off

But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for oh
What do I stand for? What do I stand for?
Most nights, I don't know anymore

Oh woah, oh woah, oh woah oh oh
Oh woah, oh woah, oh woah oh oh

This is it, boys, this is war
What are we waiting for?
Why don't we break the rules already?

I was never one to believe the hype
Save that for the black and white
I try twice as hard and I'm half as liked
But here they come again to jack my style

And that's alright
I found a martyr in my bed tonight
She stops my bones from wondering just who I am, who I am, who I am
Oh, who am I? mmm, mmm

Well, some nights, I wish that this all would end
'Cause I could use some friends for a change
And some nights, I'm scared you'll forget me again
Some nights, I always win, I always win

But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for, oh
What do I stand for? What do I stand for?
Most nights, I don't know (come on)

So this is it? I sold my soul for this?
Washed my hands of that for this?
I miss my mom and dad for this?

No. When I see stars, when I see, when I see stars, that's all they are
When I hear songs, they sound like a swan, so come on
Oh, come on
Oh, come on
Oh, come on

Well, this is it guys, that is all
Five minutes in and I'm bored again
Ten years of this, I'm not sure if anybody understands

This one is not for the folks at home
Sorry to leave, mom, I had to go
Who the fuck wants to die alone
All dried up in the desert sun?

My heart is breaking for my sister
And the con that she call ""love""
But when I look into my nephew's eyes
Man, you wouldn't believe the most amazing things that can come from

Some terrible nights
Ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh

Oh woah, oh woah, oh woah, oh oh
Oh woah, oh woah, oh woah, oh oh

The other night, you wouldn't believe the dream I just had about you and me
I called you up, but we'd both agree

It's for the best you didn't listen
It's for the best we get our distance, oh
It's for the best you didn't listen
It's for the best we get our distance, oh"
The Vamps,Middle Of The Night,"I keep coming back to that moment
Where it all fell apart
So I try and drink my emotions
Till I can't feel my heart

And I don't understand
How you slipped through my hands
And I'll do all I can
To get you out of my head

So when I call you in the middle of the night
And I'm choking on the words 'cause I miss you
Baby, don't tell me I'm out of time
I got so much of my loving to give you

In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
I need you
In the middle of the night

I've got no good explanation
For what I put you through
Managing my expectations
Is what I never do

Yeah and I don't understand
How you slipped through my hands
And I'm trying all I can
To forget you again

So when I call you in the middle of the night
And I'm choking on the words 'cause I miss you
Baby, don't tell me I'm out of time
I got so much of my loving to give you

In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
I need you

So when I call you in the middle of the night
And I'm choking on the words 'cause I miss you
Baby, don't tell me I'm out of time
I got so much of my loving to give you

In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
I need you
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
I need you"
Nathan Sykes,Famous,"I really believe in love
I really believe in love that won't die
But no matter how hard I try
I just can't make you realize
I've been here all along

When it comes to me and you
No spotlight on
'Cause you always think you can do better
Better, better

But will you call me when I'm famous
When I'm famous
Would you call my name
Will you call me when I'm famous
When I'm famous
Will you call my name
When I'm famous

Now what's a man gotta do to make you happy
Is it all about the fortune and fame
Would you care if they screamed my name
Will you still feel the same

I've been here all along
When it comes to me and you
No spotlight on
'Cause you always think you can do better
Better, better

But will you call me when I'm famous
When I'm famous
Would you call my name
Will you call me when I'm famous
When I'm famous
Now would you call my name

If I told you honestly
Honestly I don't believe
You would take a diamond ring
'Cause it would only fade

I would rather you and me
Living out another dream
Make a new reality
And hopefully
You won't only call me when I'm famous

When I'm famous
Now would you call my name
Will you call me when I'm famous
When I'm famous
Now will you call my name
When I'm famous

I really believe in love
I really believe in love that won't die
And it can only get better
Better, better
When I'm famous"
Ariana Grande,Almost Is Never Enough,"I'd like to say we gave it a try
I'd like to blame it all on life
Maybe we just weren't right, but that's a lie, that's a lie

And we can deny it as much as we want
But in time our feelings will show

'Cause sooner or later
We'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is everyone knows

Almost, almost is never enough
So close to being in love
If I would have known that you wanted me
The way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each other's arms

And we almost, we almost knew what love was
But almost is never enough

If I could change the world overnight
There'd be no such thing as goodbye
You'd be standing right where you were
And we'd get the chance we deserve

Try to deny it as much as you want
But in time our feelings will show

'Cause sooner or later
We'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is everyone knows

Almost, almost is never enough
We were so close to being in love
If I would have known that you wanted me, the way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each other's arms

And we almost, we almost knew what love was
But almost is never enough

Oh, oh baby, you know, you know, baby
Almost, baby, is never enough, baby
You know

And we can deny it as much as we want
But in time our feelings will show

'Cause sooner or later
We'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is everyone knows

Almost, almost is never enough (is never enough, babe)
We were so close to being in love (so close)

Daya,"Sit Still, Look Pretty","Could dress up, to get love
But guess what?
I'm never gonna be that girl
Who's living in a Barbie world

Could wake up, and make up, and play dumb
Pretending that I need a boy
Who's gonna treat me like a toy

And all the other girls wanna wear expensive things, and diamond rings
But I don't wanna be the puppet that you're playing on a string
This queen don't need a king

Oh, I don't know what you've been told
But this gal right here's gonna rule the world
Yeah, that's where I'm gonna be because I wanna be
No, I don't wanna sit still, look pretty

You get off on a 9 to 5
Dream of picket fences and trophy wives
But no, I'm never gonna be 'cause I don't wanna be
No, I don't wanna sit still look pretty

Mr. Right could be nice, for one night
But then he wanna take control
And I would rather fly solo

Then Snow White
She did it right in her life
Had 7 men to do the chores
'Cause that's not what a lady's for

The only thing that a boy's gonna give a girl for free's captivity
And I might love me some vanilla but I'm not that sugar sweet
Call me HBIC

Oh, I don't know what you've been told

Sure I'm a pretty girl up in a pretty world
But they say pretty hurts
And I don't wanna sit still

Eminem,Berzerk,"Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad cause my rhymes on the rag

Just like I did with addiction I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence ready to pick it
But quick get impaled when I tell 'em stick it
So sick I'm looking pale, well that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick

Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch
The art of the MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been public enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch

Take your shoes off, let your hair down and go berserk
All night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out and go berserk
All night long

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, 'cause it's mayhem ti'l the a.m.
So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So (everybody, everybody) (go berserk)
(Grab your vile and--)

Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it ain't
That aftershave or cologne that made them just faint
Plus I just showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl your body's banging, jump me in, bang -- bang, bang

Yessiree Bob I was thinking the same thing
So come get on this kids rock, baw wit da baw, bang bang
P-p-p-pow pow chicka wow wow
Catch a cab, I wanna go down, br-bow-bow
Slow it down, throw in the towel, t-t-towel towel
Dumb it down, I don't know how, how, how, how
At least I know that I don't know
Question is are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid
Hope so, now ho

Take your shoes off, let your hair down and go berserk

They say that love is powerful as cough syrup and Styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian
Lamar, oh sorry yo, we done both set the bar low

Bars hard, drugs hard thought that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock future into tomorrow
And girl I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you alone, car note

Oh, Marshall Mathers shouldn’t everybody know
Get the bar soap lathered, came ghost and called Arthur’s Cargo's
Girl you’re fixin' to get your heart broke, don’t be absurd man
You bird-brained baby I ain’t called anybody baby since Birdman
Unless you’re a swallow
Word, w-word man you heard, but don’t be discouraged girl

Eminem,Mockingbird,"Spoken
Yeah, I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey, what daddy always tell you?
Straighten up little soldier, stiffen up that upper lip
What you crying about?
You got me.

Hailie, I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone, but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry

'Cause you're scared, I ain't there? Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more crying, wipe them tears, daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Laney uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it

We're all we got in this world When it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, mama's always on the news

I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growing up his daddy, that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did

We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have gotten so bad between us I don't see us ever being together
Ever again like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason

I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream

Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night

I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise mama's gon' be alright

It's funny, I remember back one year, when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up, and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me, 'cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying

'Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time every house that we lived in either kept getting broke into and robbed
Or shot up on the block and your mom

Was saving money for you in a jar
Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad, it broke your mama's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart

Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so mama moved back
On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre and flew you and mama out to see me

But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
Then you started seeing daddy on the TV
And mama didn't like it and you and Laney were to young to understand it
Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand

'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house
Just reminiscing lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now

Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
Laney I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Shh, mama's only gone for the moment

Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night

I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise mama's gon' be alright

And if you ask me too, daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'mma give you the world
I'mma buy a diamond ring for you, I'mma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile

And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'mma break that birdies' neck
I'd go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every karat, don't fuck with dad (ha ha)"
Eminem,The Real Slim Shady,"May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat: Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here

Y'all act like you've never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (ahh!)

It's the return of the... ""Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said... nothing, you idiots
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha, ha!)

Feminist women love Eminem
""Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him walking around grabbing his you-know-what
Flipping the you-know-who."" ""Yeah, but he's so cute though""

Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms (Uhh-uhh-uhh!)
Sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose but can't
But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose

""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is

Of course they're gonna know what intercourse is by the time they hit fourth grade
They got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothing but mammals... well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes

But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope (eugh!)
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women wave your pantyhose; sing the chorus, and it goes

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you, too
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half o' you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me

""But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?""
Why, so you guys can just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Yo shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs

So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hehe""

I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (ahh!)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups; all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you

And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me, walk, talk, and act like me
And just might be the next best thing but not quite me

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

I'm like a head trip to listen to, 'cause I'm only giving you
Things you joke about with your friends, inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugar-coat it all

I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it (rip), I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums

It's funny, 'cause at the rate I'm going, when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursin' home flirting
Pinchin' nurses asses, while I'm jackin' off with Jergens
And I'm jerkin', but this whole bag of Viagra isn't workin'

In every single person there's a Slim Shady lurkin'
Who could be workin' at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot circling, screamin' ""I don't give a fuck""
With his windows down and his system up

So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Haha, guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us
Fuck it, let's all stand up"
Machine Gun Kelly,Edge Of Destruction,"(Tech N9ne)
I'm humble because I know what it feels like to be at the bottom and have nobody, no friends, no nothing, nobody believing in me, now look at me.

I was down on the ground with nobody,
Some in my town said my sound was a hobby
Now that I'm crowned they're astounded and howling,
They try and come around that now I'm somebody.

Middle finger in the air with a hope and a prayer
I started this
Never had no money then my daughter hit,
That was a 'get up and hustle' nigga starter kit
Hard to spit, bars to get at stars when it's not marketed you're far from it, dark and your partner quit.
Really barking, you wishing for the spark to get hearts and they're hard to beat.
But they doubted me, 'cause I'm nothing like I never knew how to be stylistic,
It's fawl and it's proud to be while in this,
Thinking down, it's time to get the crowd shouting
Now people found, BMX rocked people's salary.
Way back when I was feeling defeated,
When inspiration, motivation was needed.
At the pace to be great I've exceeded,
All of your expectations you fakers can eat it.

This my world, this my game,
All the wicked shit is coming out of my brain.
This my girl, music is my dame
If you can get it, I'm a get it PI mayne
When I shared the past scared that I would get the people liking me, and wouldn't dare to buy your shit.
Try to told you before that my flow's sick,
Really sold on the road with my whole clique.
Everybody listening to witness, Tech's whirlwind.
In a club with MGK, thick sex twirlin.
Fall to the top, never did stop, now we got it's ""fuck the world"" then,
The haters in the past on my ass wanna come around like my ex-girlfriends.

For the block I GO!
For that spot I GO!
To the top I GO!
Screaming fuck the world, fuck the world,
Screaming motherfuck the world, fuck the world, fuck the world,
Screaming motherfuck the world.
And that's real, how I feel 24-7 in a city when a weak man die,
Doing whatever we got to do to survive,
Hand to the sky, middle finger up high
Screaming fuck the world,
Screaming motherfuck the world, fuck the world, fuck the world,
Screaming motherfuck the world

(Twista)
I remember thinking I would rather die
Than go through what I was going through and I was struggling to survive
Full of ambition and I'm ready to ride,
No tragedy over triumph for I am a lion, I gotta try.
Full of drama, I was feeling like a failure.
Fiending for the industry, again, I was living in disgust.
Doing odd jobs, everybody seeking me,
Traveling to work, back on forth from the bus.
Yeah, I was fucked up, but I got it together for y'all
Spit venomous lyrics, 'cause I was ready to ball
Started po pimping of everybody and certain motherfuckers that wanna get in my circle, I tell 'em no.
'Cause I gotta get money up in my anatomy, naturally,
And I gotta be gradually happy to holler.
And somebody wanna speak and they might be on that bullshit,
So sometimes I just fuck 'em, I don't even bother.

And who knows what's next for three haters chasing dreams,
Hailing from the midwest as we're spread our wings.
All of us striving to over the summit,
Creatin' us a vision that will be stunning
We'll become the urban city and do a show,
You would get to see everybody for miles come running
Yelling for Machine Gun Kelly,
And Tech N9ne and Twista get it in
Better bring somethin' smelly
We can take it to another level wherever you wanna go,
Everybody put up your hands, I'm ready.
Come on, get wild let loose,
Celebrate the fact that you made it and let me see you get buck.
You done been through some shit,
But you did it 'cause you had the heart to put the middle finger up.

For the block I GO!
For that spot I GO!
To the top I GO!
Screaming fuck the world, fuck the world,
Screaming motherfuck the world, fuck the world, fuck the world,
Screaming motherfuck the world.
And that's real, how I feel 24-7 in a city when a weak man die,
Doing whatever we got to do to survive,
Hand to the sky, middle finger up high
Screaming fuck the world,
Screaming motherfuck the world, fuck the world, fuck the world,
Screaming motherfuck the world

(Machine Gun Kelly)
From the back streets to the pack sheets,
On a block, running from cops like athletes
Whoever would've imagined Lace Up could've got me to the finish like track meets.
And when everybody's hot, I'm past heat,
And if I don't need the fuel, don't gas me.
It's been a long time coming since 100 Words and Runnin', mother fucker, come catch me.
And when these other rappers pen and pad it I was thirteen, with a semi-automatic
Anything we ever wanted, then you know that we gotta have it,
Don't nobody ever snitch, get pinched you forget like magic.
Kids carry tools like go-go-gadget,
Leaving high school through an open casket
Now another baby in the stomach of a baby, mother's never gonna know his daddy. tragic.
Why the government got to lie to get money?
What the federal reserve gotta take from me,
What should I be fighting for another country?
Have you seen my city? Motherfucker, we're hungry.
Representing for the middle of the map even though me and mine are coming from the bottom
Why do all greats fall when it isn't autumn?
Where would Pac be at if nobody woulda shot him?

Do you really think that Notorious B would believe these guys
Or the Internet thugs that the media finds?
You wanna talk about grind, look in the encyclopedia,
What name is in there, bet you see mine.
Mother fucker this Kells,
Skinny boy six foot three,
Heart bigger than a SUV,
Lord knows I've been through hell and back, put in jail and crack,
But still I came out TOP.
So this is for the kid who never had a father figure to depend on
Spending every school day being sent home
Feeling like he doesn't know anybody because the only thing he gives a head to him was some headphones
So he picked a song and he turned 'em on, every mornin just to get him through the day.
Looking for escape and a kick and the bass, that's the story of MGK,
Lace up.

For the block I GO!
For that spot I GO!
To the top I GO!
Screaming fuck the world, fuck the world,
Screaming motherfuck the world, fuck the world, fuck the world,
Screaming motherfuck the world.
And that's real, how I feel 24-7 in a city when a weak man die,
Doing whatever we got to do to survive,
Hand to the sky, middle finger up high
Screaming fuck the world,
Screaming motherfuck the world, fuck the world, fuck the world,
Screaming motherfuck the world"
Machine Gun Kelly,On My Way,"Okay, now they say home is where the hate is.
Pulling up high haters.
I know, I've been on a hiatus, caught up in the lights, I've been blinded by Las Vegas.
Ain't it ironic? Before I was 21 I put my future on the table and I won
See, they told me life's a gamble, now this is my casino
Make sure my fellows good, now I'm Robert DeNiro,
Sipping cleco with the girl that held me down from the beginning,
My team throwing up Ls, but it's funny, 'cause we're winning,
A million talked down, soon as I rose from the bottom,
But opinions ass holes now, everybody got 'em.

So they ask me why I do it, I do it for the streets
Heard mama got out the crib, man, I do it for the greeds,
Man, I do it for the five pack of Haines wife beats
That I wore like everyday to show off my brand new ink
Shit I remember working jobs so I just can hit the dance up,
Never had a date, so I really didn't dance much.
Couldn't buy my own, so I just borrowed my dad's tux,
Told him keep the loafers, kept it gully with my black chucks.
So we could keep watching the stars, but me, I wanna be 'em
And I just beat the odds, guess we can call it even
'Cause he the underdog went from flipping patties at a Fuddruckers
To living lavish than a motherfucker, God damn.

Hold up
Okay, I heard they want the classics, my life's a movie like the Truman Show, without the cameras.
They look at us like we're a couple boys in the hood,
Four brothers to the end like them boys in the wood.
So I light it up for the Friday night lights with the team
And a notebook, call it Requiem for a dream.
I was super bad in the class, I just dazed off,
So I play sick and lived Ferris Bueller's day off.
Back in Coolie high students used to nickname us the Goonies
Every night we blacked out, shit, they should've called us roofies.
Get out the bed, half baked, roll another doobie.
So many snacks up in the house, they call the crib Scooby.
Blow an oiee and man, man I swear this is good as it gets,
Godfather told me keep doing that music shit.
He said your piece of the American pie is waiting
From the bottom to the top, almost famous, Kells."
Machine Gun Kelly,Runnin',"Runnin' I ain't running away [x3]
Cause, I'm so tired of Runnin'

(Verse 1: MGK)
I'm so tired of running, that I've worn my soles
Out, to the point that my toes is out, to the point that I can't look back and even if I did I still couldn't see where I started out, can't see home for miles, I'm
Lost like another orphan child, I'm only grinning 'cause I'm supposed to smile, so I do it for the ones that are down and out proud one of theirs is gonna be
A spokesman now, and I'm still running, running, but I don't know where, all I got to my name is one pair, of laced up chucks, 5 bucks, and a chip on my
Shoulder that's so big that I cannot bare, I done lost my friends, family, and home for this, and for that I have lost my mind, kept my faith, lost my direction
I'm just hoping that I haven't lost my time, Go!

I keep my head up, with my feet on the ground, From the bottom so up is the only place that I'm
Going, Ready to face all that's in front of me now, Cause, I'm so tired of Runnin' I'm walking through the fire, cause their is no way around, Moving in the same
Direction wherever the wind is blowing Ready to face what's in front of me now, Cause

I'm so tired of Runnin' Runnin' I ain't running away [x3] Cause, I'm so
Tired of Runnin'

I'm so tired of struggling, I'm so tired of hustling, I can feel my heart fill with hate, I'm so tired of loving, I was supposed
To be great, I'm so tired of ducking, Tired of coming home from my job being fired from nothing, And shit I'm tired, from the nights a motherfucker took that
Ride, to make that dream come alive, then wake up in the morning to a 9 to 5, but I gotta do it if I wanna survive, because in the city where I'm from it's
Either do or die, so choose it wise because you could lose it in the blink of an eye but even in the darkest times it's proven I

I keep my head up
With my feet on the ground, From the bottom so up is the only place that I'm going, Ready to face all that's in front of me now, Cause, I'm so tired of Runnin'
I'm walking through the fire, cause their is no way around, Moving in the same direction wherever the wind is blowing Ready to face what's in front of me

Now, Cause, I'm so tired of Runnin' Runnin' I ain't running away [x3]
Cause, I'm so tired of Runnin'"
Machine Gun Kelly,End Of The Road,"Yeah, it's a long way home at the end of the road
I'll be pavin my own way, to the top, I be here to stay
So take my name, remember this face, keep the change and have a nice day
And live for the moment, not by the past, hommie live each day like it's your last

All my life, I couldn't fit in, like a bad shoe
I was always too square, too cube, too tall, too weird, too blue
Forget them high-school's hotties now I'm too cool
I guess I came a long way from that young kid
The school's most popular lame, no friends, no style, no clothes, no ends
Just a bear fell asleep, never woke up again
Yeah, and my last prayer was don't ever let me end up like the people that's down here
Cause the one that fear change be the one that don't care
Look at themselves and see somebody else in the mirror
But you can always pick me out of the crowd
Loud mouth with my very own style
And what I know now is don't ever pretend
And live every single day like you won't see it again

So take my name, remember this face, keep the change and have a nice day
And live for the moment, not by the past, hommie live each day like it's your last

And if you only had 24 hours, 1400 minutes before your dreams gone
Then you better go live it, cause whatever you love could be taken away
So live like it's your dying day
I dedicate this to my teachers that never believed in me
And the mother that conceived, 'fore ended up leaving me
I just wish you all can see me smile, this big's grin on the TV now
And I took it from the bottom to the top
From the holes in my socks ramen noodles in the pot
Used to rob them on the block, now they spot me in the drop
Middle finger up and that ain't gonna stop
I used to take orders, now I make bets
I used to scrub floors, now I sign checks
I used to push carts, now I push songs
I used to be there, now I am so gone

I fired myself, found a job myself
Established my name and then I signed myself
And when I tell myself, is you did this by yourself
And when I'm on so long, I'll be by myself

So take my name, remember this face, keep the change and have a nice day
And live for the moment, not by the past, hommie live each day like it's the last
And if you only had 24 hours, 1400 minutes before your dreams gone
Then you better go live it, cause whatever you love could be taken away
So live like it's your dying day

I wish I could see their faces when they heard your boy spit
Wish I could know what they're thinking when they heard my first hit
'Cause I remember them wishing that I wouldn't get big
Now I bet they're wishing they wouldn't of said that shit
I came out of a dying city brought back life
Everything they said I couldn't do I did about twice
Multiplied by the bottles that we popped each night
That equals out to a celebration, bitches more ice
Make a toast to the underdogs, toast to the team
Toast to the fact, we this close to the dream
Pour one for my exes, used to talk reckless
But now I push Benzes and rock Rolexes
Came from the city and until they come and get me
Turn around and see the whole east side's still with me
And that's how we live it, you man's don't change
Look, instead of keys you still can't tell me a goddamn thing

So take my name, remember this face, keep the change and have a nice day
And live for the moment, not by the past, hommie live each day like it's the last
And if you only had 24 hours, 1400 minutes before your dreams go
Then you better go live it, cause whatever you love could be taken away
So live like it's a dying day.

Yeah, it's a long way home at the end of the road
I'll be pavin my own way, to the top, I be here to stay
So take my name, remember this face, keep the change and have a nice day
And live for the moment, not by the past, hommie live each day like it's your last."
Machine Gun Kelly,Invincible,"Voices in the air
I hear 'em loud and clear
Telling me to listen
Whispers in my ear
Nothing can compare
I just wanna listen

As my world turns, the heart beats
Not only in my chest, but the heart in the streets
So when they feel this, they feel me
But I can't feel nothin', outside these Dre Beats
I am from the city of people, came from the bottom
Standing on top of what was supposed to be my coffin, what's up?
Except for shows, we are the dead man walkin'
But reflections show this kid's still got it
Better be known I got the throne like I don't know that there's a king
Never grew up around a family because I'm not a human being
And anyone under my bubble that's coming in my spot, for the top
Let 'em have it, 'cause when I leave, the whole world drops
Lace up Kells

I hear voices in the air
I hear it loud and clear
They're telling me to listen
Whispers in my ear
Nothing can compare
I just want to listen
Telling me
I'm invincible
Telling me
I'm invincible
I am

Waking up sweatin' from the stress of being caged out
Everything I write is played out like what is this
Tear the whole page out
Man I come from holes in the wall but they don't know the past
Even if I told them it all they wouldn't know the half
So maybe I fill up my luggage with all these dreams
And pull on my black coat and my black chucks and nothing in my jeans
It's just one, till the day come like Rocky's movie scene
The day I'm on top of the world, look up the screen like this is me,
This is Kells
Crucified by the public without the nails
Do or die in my city but clearly I never failed
Lost myself from the game when I found myself from the cell
And I found myself from the fame when I lost myself in the pills
And you cannot mess with me still, seen the boys and they winnin'
Underdogs of the year, Cleveland boys in the buildin'
What the fuck is a ceiling?
I'm taking us to the top
And when I leave the whole world drops
Lace up Kells

I hear voices in the air
I hear it loud and clear
They're telling me to listen
Whispers in my ear
Nothing can compare
I just wanna listen
Telling me
I'm invincible
Telling me
I'm invincible
I am"

Rain, in the rain. Rain, rain.
Every day I wake up to the same shit
In the same house with the same bricks,
In the same clothes with the same kicks
I might as well be in jail caged in.
Starin' at the wall waitin for a change, but
Dad telling me I gotta get a job.
Couldn't pay the bill so the light turned off.
Them Cleveland boys got it hard.
Oh my God, we living like this too long
Just to lose it all in a week.
My people just too strong.
Get it? Me and my boys be gone.
Puffing on weed like it's the lawn.
Me and my boys tired of being here.
That is why we're gone.
They say we wouldn't amount to nothing, huh.
Y'all thought we was bluffing, ha?
Fought every temptation shit, I guess I'm David ruffin huh?
Nowadays, we don't gotta do that dirt, tell my boys they good.
And nowadays my little girl won't have to work, moved her out the hood.
Look man, I been through it all, and I'm a damned if I got this far,
And I let them strip me of message let these haters take my heart.
This for the ones that had it hard, the ones like me, the underdogs.
This for the ones that waited for them clouds to fall, please God let it
You can't see my tears in the, in the rain.
You can't see my tears in the, in the rain.
Underneath it all, we're just the same, same, same.
You can't see my tears in the, in the rain.

You can't see my tears in the, in the rain.
So I let it rain.
And they mad that I made it out the city.
But if you look I'm still out in the city.
Before anything I had cloud in the city.
Two other states and never bounced in the city.
Shout out to everybody that's proud in the city.
Everybody cheering in the crowd from the city.
Everyone that never had doubts in the city.
'Cause they know I represent what we about in the city.
And I'm still laced up, tell the world that's nothing changed.
Till it's hundred dollar bills in my pocket, then nothings changed.
If my teammate with me, then I don't wanna thang.
Tell them I'll go broke before I run out on my game.
EST over everythang.
100 thousand plus, cult fan base yeah that is us, my songs tattooed on their body.
Troubled youth We bad as fuck.
And what?
Nobody gave a shit for broken mirrors.
So I care less about appearance.
Just as long as they can hear us.
We're fearless, we're stupid, we're dealers, we're losers.
We're killers, we're orphans, we're addicts, we're stealers.
We're shooters so kill us.
We are what they say we are until conformity hits us.
Or those clouds come down and take them all with us, please God let it
You can't see my tears in the, in the rain.
You can't see my tears in the, in the rain.

Marshmallows catch fire on an open flame
All my friends get together
Wishing I was there but I'm never
Living in the sunshine oh but dreaming of a place called home

I wanna run wanna run away-ay
I'm dreaming of a place called home
I could try but I'm stuck in today
I'm dreaming of a place that's
3000 miles away
Feels like it's forever
Seems like yesterday
We were running 'round town together
This place, just ain't the same
I miss the stormy weather
I'm not okay
3000 miles away

You don't pick up but I keep redialing
'Cause you're asleep got your phone on silent
Still early here I'm wide awake
I just wanna hear you tell me all about your day
Although I never really showed it
I had to leave for me to notice
That living in the sunshine's cold I'm dreaming of a place called home

I wanna run wanna run away-ay
I'm dreaming of a place called home
I could try but I'm stuck in today
I'm dreaming of a place that's 3000 miles away
Feels like it's forever
Seems like yesterday
We were running 'round town together
This place, just ain't the same
I miss the stormy weather
I'm not okay
3000 miles

If I could go back for the weekend
Or just for a day
To see familiar faces, that's all it would take
But it's too far

x2:
3000 miles away
Feels like it's forever
Seems like yesterday
We were running around town together
This place, just ain't the same
I miss the stormy weather
I'm not okay
3000 miles away"
Lana Del Rey,High By The Beach,"Boy look at you, looking at me
I know you know how I feel
Loving you is hard, being here is harder
You take the wheel
I don't wanna do this anymore
It's so surreal
I can't survive, if this is all that's real

All I wanna do is get high by the beach
Get high by the beach, get high
All I wanna do is get by by the beach
Get by baby, baby bye-bye

The truth is I never bought into your bullshit
When you would pay tribute to me 'cause I knew that
All I wanted to do was get high by the beach
Get high baby, baby bye-bye

Boy look at you, looking at me
I know you don't understand
You could be a bad motherfucker
But that don't make you a man
Now you're just another one of my problems
Because you got out of hand
We won't survive, we're sinking into the sand

All I wanna do is get high by the beach
Get high by the beach, get high
All I wanna do is get by by the beach
Get by baby, baby bye-bye

The truth is I never bought into your bullshit
When you would pay tribute to me 'cause I knew that
All I wanted to do was get high by the beach
Get high baby, baby bye-bye

Lights, camera, acción
I'll do it on my own
Don't need your money, money
To get me what I want

Lights, camera, acción
I'll do it on my own
Don't need your money, money
To get me what I want

All I wanna do is get high by the beach
Get high by the beach, get high
All I wanna do is get by by the beach
Get by baby, baby bye-bye

The truth is I never bought into your bullshit
When you would pay tribute to me 'cause I knew that
All I wanted to do was get high by the beach
Get high baby, baby bye-bye

Anyone can start again
Not through love but through revenge
Through the fire we're born again
Peace by vengeance brings the end"
David Archuleta,Touch My Hand,"Saw you from the distance,
Saw you from the stage,
Something 'bout the look in your eyes,
Something 'bout your beautiful face,
In a sea of people,
There was only you,
I never knew what this song was about,
But suddenly now I do,

Trying to reach out to you,
Touch my hand,
Reach out as far as you can,
Only me, only you, and the band,
Trying to reach out to you,
Touch my hand,

Can't let the music stop,
Can't let this feeling end,
'Cause if I do it'll all be over,
I'll never see you again,

Can't let the music stop,
Until I touch your hand,
'Cause if I do it'll all be over,
I'll never get the chance again,
I'll never get the chance again,
I'll never get the chance again,

I see the sparkle of a million flashlights,
I wonder why all the the stars,
But the one that's shining out so bright,
Is the one right where you are,

Trying to reach out to you,
Touch my hand,
Reach out as far as you can,
Only me, only you, and the band,
Trying to reach out to you,
Touch my hand,

Can't let the music stop,
Can't let this feeling end,

Can't let the music stop,
Until I touch your hand,
'Cause if I do it'll all be over,
I'll never get the chance again,
I'll never get the chance again,

Trying to reach out to you,
Touch my hand, (I'll never get the chance again)
Reach out as far as you can, (I'll never get the chance again)

Trying to reach out to you,
Touch my hand,

David Archuleta,A Little Too Not Over You,"It never crossed my mind at all
That's what I tell myself
What we had has come and gone
You're better off with someone else
It's for the best, I know it is
But I see you

Sometimes I try to hide what I feel inside
And I turn around, you're with him now
I just can't figure it out

Tell me why you're so hard to forget
Don't remind me, I'm not over it
Tell me why I can't seem to face the truth
I'm just a little too not over you
Not over you

Memories supposed to fade
What's wrong with my heart?
Shake it off, let it go
Didn't think it be this hard
Should be strong, moving on
But I see you

Sometimes I try to hide what I feel inside
And I turn around, you're with him now
I just can't figure it out

Tell me why you're so hard to forget
Don't remind me, I'm not over it
Tell me why I can't seem to face the truth
I'm just a little too not over you

Maybe I regret everything I said
No way to take it all back, yeah
Now I'm on my own, how I let you go
I'll never understand
I'll never understand
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh
Oh, Ooh, oh

Tell me why you're so hard to forget
Don't remind me, I'm not over it
Tell me why I can't seem to face the truth
I'm just a little too not over you

Tell me why you're so hard to forget
Don't remind me, I'm not over it
Tell me why I can't seem to face the truth
And I really don't know what to do
I'm just a little too not over you
Not over you, ooh..."
David Archuleta,Crush,"Ooh oh
Ooh oh

I hung up the phone tonight
Something happened for the first time
Deep inside
It was a rush
What a rush (what a rush)

'Cause the possibility
That you would ever feel the same way
About me
It's just too much
Just too much (just too much)

Why do I keep running from the truth?
All I ever think about is you
You've got me hypnotized, so mesmerized
And I just got to know

Do you ever think
When you're all alone
All that we could be
Where this thing could go?
Am I crazy or falling in love?
Is it real or just another crush?

Do you catch a breath
When I look at you?
Are you holding back
Like the way you do?
'Cause I'm trying, trying to walk away
But I know this crush ain't going away
Going away

Has it ever crossed your mind
When we're hangin', spendin' time
Girl, are we just friends?
Is there more?
Is there more?

See, it's a chance we've gotta take
'Cause I believe
That we can make this into
Something that will last
Last forever
Forever

Do you ever think when you're all alone
All that we could be, where this thing could go?
Am I crazy or falling in love?
Is it real or just another crush?

Do you catch a breath when I look at you?
Are you holding back, like the way you do?
'Cause I'm trying, trying to walk away
But I know this crush ain't going away
Going away

Why do I keep running from the truth? (why do I keep running)
All I ever think about is you (all I ever think about)

Do you ever think (ever think) when you're all alone (all alone)
All that we could be, where this thing could go? (go)
Am I crazy or falling in love? (crazy)
Is it real or just another crush? (another crush, yeah, yeah)

Do you catch a breath when I look at you?
Are you holding back, like the way you do?
'Cause I'm trying, trying to walk away (whoa)
But I know this crush ain't goin' away (this crush ain't)
Goin' away
Goin' away
Goin' away"
Jason Mraz,You And I Both,"Was it you who spoke the words that things would happen but not to me
Oh things are gonna happen naturally
Oh taking your advice and I'm looking on the bright side
And balancing the whole thing

Oh but at often times those words get tangled up in lines
And the bright light turns to night
Oh until the dawn it brings
Another day to sing about the magic that was you and me

'Cause you and I both loved
What you and I spoke of
And others just read of
Others only read of the love
Oh the love that I love
La la la la

See I'm all about them words
Over numbers, unencumbered numbered words
Hundreds of pages, pages, pages for words
More words than I had ever heard
And I feel so alive

'Cause you and I both loved
What you and I spoke of
And others just read of
And if you could see me now
Oh love, love

You and I you and I
Not so little you and I any more
And with this silence brings a moral story
More importantly evolving
Is the glory of a boy

'Cause you and I both loved
What you and I spoke of
And others just read of
And if you could see me now
Well then I'm almost finally out of
I'm finally out of
Finally de de de de de de de,
Well I'm almost finally, finally,
Well I am free, oh, I'm free

And it's okay
If you had to go away
Oh just remember the telephones
Well they work in both ways
(Additional lyrics from live version:
And the more you follow through,
There's always more left over,
And not too much explaining to do.
And if ever you find your love,
I will be your lifeline,
I will never miss your phonecall)
But if I never, ever hear them ring
If nothing else
I'll think the bells inside have finally found you someone else
And that's okay
'Cause I'll remember everything you sang

'Cause you and I both loved
What you and I spoke of
And others just read of
And if you could see me now
Well then I'm almost finally out of
I'm finally out of, finally de de de de de de de de,
Well I'm almost finally, finally,
Out of words."
Jason Mraz,Life Is Wonderful,"It takes a crane to build a crane
It takes two floors to make a story
It takes an egg to make a hen
It takes a hen to make an egg
There is no end to what I'm saying

It takes a thought to make a word
And it takes some words to make an action
It takes some work to make it work
It takes some good to make it hurt
It takes some bad for satisfaction

Ah, la, la, la, life is wonderful
Ah, la, la, la, life goes full circle
Ah, la, la, la, life is wonderful
Ah, la, la, la

It takes a night to make it dawn
And it takes a day to make you yawn, brother
And it takes some old to make you young
It takes some cold to know the sun
It takes the one to have the other

And it takes no time to fall in love
But it takes you years to know what love is
And It takes some fears to make you trust
It takes those tears to make it rust
It takes the dust to have it polished, yeah

Ah, la, la, la, life is wonderful
Ah, la, la, la, life goes full circle
Ah, la, la, la, life is wonderful
Ah, la, la, la
It is so...

It takes some silence to make sound
And it takes a loss before you found me
And it takes a road to go nowhere
It takes a toll to make you care
It takes a hole to make a mountain

Ah, la, la, la, life is wonderful
Ah, la, la, la, life goes full circle
Ah, la, la, la, life is wonderful
Ah, la, la, la, life is meaningful
Ah, la, la, la, life is wonderful
Ah, la, la, la

It is so wonderful
It is so meaningful
It is so wonderful
It is meaningful
It is wonderful
It is meaningful
It goes full circle
Wonderful
Meaningful
Full circle
Wonderful"
Jason Mraz,Wordplay,"I've been all around the world
I've been a new sensation
But it doesn't really matter
In this ge-generation
The sophomore slump is an uphill battle
And someone said it ain't my scene

'Cause they need a new song
Like a new religion
Music for the television
I can't do the long division
Someone do the math

For the record label puts me on the shelf up in the freezer
Got to find another way to live the life of leisure
So I drop my top, mix and I mingle
Is everybody ready for the single and it goes

Ah, la, la, la, la
Listen closer to the verse I lay
Ah, la, la, la, la
It's all about the wordplay
Ah, la, la, la, love
The wonderful thing it does
Because, because
I am the wizard of ooh's and ah's and fa-la-la's and
The Mister A-Z
They say I'm all about the wordplay

When it's time to get ill
I got your remedy for those who don't remember me
Well, let me introduce you to my style
I try to keep a jumble in the lyrics
Never mumble
When the music's making people tongue-tied

You want a new song
Like a new religion
Music for the television
I can't do the long division
Someone do the math

For the people write me off like I'm a one-hit wonder
Got to find another way to keep from going under
Pull out the stops- got your attention
I guess it's time again for me to mention the wordplay

Ah, la, la, la, la
Listen closer to the verse I lay
Ah, la, la, la, la
It's all about the wordplay
Ah, la, la, la, love
The wonderful thing it does
Because, because
I am the wizard of ooh's and ah's and fa-la-la's and
The Mister A-Z
They say I'm all about the wordplay

I built a bridge across the stream of consciousness
It always seems to be a flowing
But I don't know which way my brain is going
Oh, the ryhming and the timing
Keeps the melodies inside me
And they're climbing
Till I'm running out of air
Are you prepared to take a dive into the deep end of my head
Are you listening to a single word I've said

Ah, la, la, la, la
Listen closely to the words I say
Ah, la, la, la, la
I'm sticking to the wordplay
Ah, la, la, la, love
The wonderful thing it does
Because, because
I am the wizard of ooh's and ah's and fa-la-la's
Yeah, the Mister A-Z
They say I'm all about the wordplay

Ah, la, la, la, la
I'm all about the wordplay
Ah, la, la, la, la
Stickin' with the wordplay
Ah, la, la, la, love
I love the wonderful thing it does
Because, because
The ooh's and ah's and fa-la-la's are back in love
For the Mister A-Z, they say
Is all about the wordplay"
Jason Mraz,Geek In The Pink,"Yo, brotha A to Z!
Yo, wussup B?
Yo, what time is it?
Ha-ha
It's laundry day!
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do do do do-do...
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do do do do-do...

Well, let the geek in the pink take a stab at it
If you like the way I'm thinking baby, wink at it
I may be skinny at times but I'm fat fulla rhymes
Pass me the mic and I'mma grab at it

Well isn't it delicious, crazy way that I'm kissing
'Cause baby, listen to this, don't wanna miss it while it's hitting
Sometimes you gotta fit in to get in, but
Don't ever quit cause soon I'm gonna let you in, but see

I don't care what you might think about me
You'll get by without me if you want

Well, I could be the one to take you home
Baby, we could rock the night alone
If we never get down, it wouldn't be a let-down
But sugar, don't forget what you already know

That I could be the one to turn you out
We could be the talk across the town
Don't judge it by the color, confuse it for another
You might regret what you let slip away

Like the geek in the pink
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do do do do-do...
Well, like the geek in the pink, yeah
(The geek in the pink)
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do do do do-do...

Well, my relationship fodder don't mean to bother nobody
But Cupid's automatic musta fired multiple shots at her
Because she fall in love too often, that's what the matter
At least I'm talking 'bout it, keep my pattern of flattery and

She was staring through the door frame and
Eying me down, like already a bad boyfriend
Well, she can get her toys outta the drawer then
'Cause I ain't coming home, I don't need that attention, see

I don't care what she might think about me
She'll get by without me if she want

But I could be the one to take her home
Baby, we could rock the night alone
If we never get down, it wouldn't be a let-down
But sugar, don't forget what you already know

That I could be the one to turn you out
We could be the talk across the town
Don't judge it by the color, confuse it for another
You might regret what you let slip away

Hey baby, look at me go
From zero to hero
You better take it from a geek like me
Well, I can save you from unoriginal dum-dums
Who wouldn't care if you com...
...Plete them or not

So what?, I've got a short attention span
A Coke in my hand
Because I'd rather have the afternoon, relax and understand
My hip hop and flip-flops well it don't stop with the light rock
My shot to mock you kinda puts me in a tight spot

The hype is nothing more than hoo-ha so
I'm developing a language and I'm calling it my own
So take a peek into the speaker and you'll see what I mean
That on the other side the grass is greener

I don't care what you might think about me
You'll get by without me if you want

I could be the one to take you home
Baby, we could rock the night alone
If we never get down, it wouldn't be a let-down
But sugar, don't forget what you already know

That I could be the one to turn you out
We could be the talk across the town
Don't judge it by the color, confuse it for another
You might regret what you let slip away

Like the geek in the pink
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do do do do-do...
I'm the geek in the pink y'all
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do do do do-do...
Geek is the color for fall
I'm the geek in the pink
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do do do do-do...
So I'm the geek y'all
In the pink y'all
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do do do do-do...
Geek is the color for fall

Jason Mraz,Did You Get My Message?,"Did you get my message
The one I left while I was trying to condense everything that I meant
In a minute or less when I called to confess and make all of my stresses go bye-bye

Did you get my message
Didn't, I guess, 'cause if you did you would have called me with your sweet intent
And we could give it a rest instead of beating our breast, making all of the pressure go sky-high

Do you ever wonder what happens to the words that we send
Do they bend, do they break from the flight that they take
And come back together again with a whole new meaning
In a brand new sense, completely unrelated to the one I sent

Did you get my message, ooh
Did you get my message
Did you get my message, yeah, ooh

Uh oh, where did it go
Must have bypassed your phone and flown right outta the window
Oh well, how can I tell
Should I call the operator
Maybe she know the info
But whether or not if my message you got was too much or a lot to reply
Why not try this for a fact
Should you ever come back
I'd relax and be relieved of all my panic attacks

Ah ooh
Did you get my message, ooh
Did you get my message, (Did you now?)
Did you get my message, yeah, ooh

Did you get my message, the one that I left
While I was trying to condense everything that I meant
Now the moment is passed
Not much sand in the glass and I'm standing to lose my mind

Do you ever wonder what happens to the words that we send
Do they bend, do they break from the flight that they take
And come back together again with a whole new meaning
To the matter of our love's defense, and please be sympathetic to the time I spent

Did you get my message, ooh
Did you get my message, (Did you now?)
Did you get my message, yeah, ooh

Did you get my message
No, I didn't hear a word
Did you get my message
Now I'm not gonna believe your lies anymore
Answer the question
I don't hear a thing from you and you keep saying you're coming
Did you get my message now that I wanna get back with you
Did you get my message, love that I wanna reconnect with you
Did you get my message, sugar now
I did not hear one thing you sent to me
Did you get my message, love

Jason Mraz,Mr. Curiosity,"Hey Mr. Curiosity
Is it true what they've been saying about you
Are you killing me?
You took care of the cat already
And for those who think it's heavy
Is it the truth
Or is it only gossip
Call it mystery or anything
Oh just as long as you call me
I sent the message on did you get it when I left it
Said well this catastrophic event
It wasn't meant to mean no harm
But to think there's nothing wrong is a problem, oh

I'm looking for love this time
Sounding hopeful but it's making me cry
Love is a mystery
Mr. Curious...

Come back to me
Mr. waiting-ever-patient can't you see
That I'm the same the way you left me
Hurry to spell check me
And I'm underlined already in envy green
And pencil red
And I've forgotten what you've said
Will you stop working for the dead and return
Mr. Curious, well I need some inspiration
It's my birthday and I cannot find no cause for celebration
The scenario is grave but I'll be braver when you save me
From this situation laden with hearsay

I'm looking for love this time
Sounding hopeful but it's making me cry
This love is a mystery
Mr. Curiosity
Be Mr. Please
Do come and find me, oh
Oh, come on oh, yea yea

I'm looking for love this time
Sounding hopeful but it's making me cry
Trying not to ask why
Cause love is a mystery
Mr. Curiosity
Be Mr. Please
Do come and find me

Love is blinding when the timing's never right
Oh but who am I to beg for difference
Finding love in a distant instant
But I don't mind, at least I've tried
Oh, well I tried..."
Jason Mraz,Clockwatching,"Take off, both your, shoes and clothes, I'll follow
Undo, corkscrew, drink from the half of a broken bottle
Lately we're running out of time, aren't we?

Smoking, often, and calling out our guilty pleasures
Let's keep, talking, anything to stop clockwatching
Lately we're running out of time, aren't we?
Crazy for running all the time, m-m-m-m-maybe
Let's forget we're running out of time

I'm off like an aeroplane
I'm licking your postage stamp again
I'm using my right brain and I'm praying that we don't crash
Who knew I'd cum so fast
Well, so what if a two pump chump can't last

But I made it to three, and I foreclose a five minute fantasy
On a short-lived flight, making love on economy
No jumping, conclusions
'An I don't think there's no solution
Let's get, backwards
And forget our restless destination

Let's live in the moment just this time, could we?
Just take one moment of our time, m-m-m-m-maybe
Let's forget we're running out of time

I'm off like an aeroplane
I'm catching my second wind again
I'm using my left brain
And I'm righting all my wrongs
I'm yearning to turn you on

I've been working on getting you off, so get on board, now
Well how can I guess by the subject of the best predicate that's left unsaid when the matter is too delicate
My loneliness is evident

And it's you
You're running through my mind and it makes me c-c-crazy cra-cra-crazy

La la la
La la la la la
La la la (ooh, it's so amazing)
La la la la la la

Laaaa oh oh
Laaaaaa lo oh oh oh

Tonight, sleep tight, and build your nest upon my shoulder"
Jason Mraz,Bella Luna,"Mystery, the moon
A hole in the sky
A supernatural nightlight
So full but often bright
A pair of eyes a-closing one
A chosen child in golden sun
A marble dog that chases cars
To farthest reaches of the beach and
Far beyond into the swimming sea of stars

The cosmic fish, they love to kiss
They're giving birth to constellations
No ""if's"" and, oh, no reservations
If they should fall you'd get a wish or dedication

May I suggest you get the best
For nothing less than you and I
Let's take a chance as this romance is rising o'er
Before we lose the lighting

Oh, bella, bella, please
Bella, you beautiful luna
Oh, bella, do what you do

(Da, dum...)

You are an illuminating anchor
Of leagues to infinite number
Of crashing waves and breaking thunder
Tiding the ebb and flows of hunger
You're dancing naked there for me
You expose all memory
You make the most of boundary
You're the ghost of royalty
Imposing love, you are the queen and king
Combining everything
Intertwining like the ring around the finger of a girl
I'm just a singer, you're the world
All I can bring ya is the language of a lover
(The language, the language, the language of love)

Bella luna, my beautiful, beautiful moon-a
How you swoon me like no other, oh

(Ba, ba,...)

May I suggest you get the best of your wish
May I insist at no contest for little you or smaller I
A larger chance set, but all them may lie
On the rise of the brink of our lives

Bella, please
Bella, you beautiful luna
Oh, bella, do what you do

Bella luna, my beautiful, beauiful moon
How you swoon me like no other"

The windows for sleepin'

Well who's laughin' now that I'm leaving your town, again
And I'm over the ground that you've been spinning
And I'm up in the air so baby hell yeah
Well honey I can see your house from here
If the plane goes down, damn
I remember where the love was found
If the plane goes down, damn

Damn, I should be so lucky
Even only 24 hours under your touch
You know I need you so much
I cannot wait to call you
And tell you that I landed somewhere
And hand you a square of the airport
And walk you through the maze of the map that I'm gazing at
Gracefully unnamed and feeling guilty for the luck
And the look that you gave me
You make me somebody
Oh nobody knows me
Not even me can see it yet I bet I'm

Leaving your town again
And I'm over the ground that you've been spinning
And I'm up in the air, so baby hell yeah
Oh honey I can see your house from here
If the plane goes down, damn
I'll remember where the love was found
If the plane goes down, damn

You keep me high minded
You keep me high

Flax seeds, well they tear me open
And supposedly you can crawl right through me
Taste these teeth please
And undress me from the sweaters better hurry
'Cause I'm heating upward bound now
Oh maybe I'll build my house on your cloud
Here I'm tumbling for you
Stumblin' through the work that I have to do
Don't mean to harm you

By leaving your town again
But I'm over the quilt that you've been spinning
And I'm up in the air, said baby hell yeah
Well honey I can see your house from here
If the plane goes down, damn
I remember where the love was found
If the plane goes down, damn
I remember where the love was found
If the plane goes down, damn
I remember where the love was found
If the plane goes down, damn
Damn
Damn

Damn you...

You get me high
You keep me high minded
You get me high
You keep me high minded"
Jason Mraz,O. Lover,"What's the worst thing that could happen
We could change our minds
That seems to be the hottest topic at this time
We sitting around in the meditation, dragon changing
Wondering who's holding who's got the will to draw the line

I know you've got something burning up inside
It's so unhealthy but so good for me, oh
Said if I didn't know, and if I didn't know, well if I didn't know
That you loved me, would you TEMPT me?

God only knows our contradictions to quitting
Is a hate love relationship thing
A fire under you is so fulfilling
I feel there's nothing more

I'm giving, giving you, the choke hold
My flirting with disaster is modern love
Oh, you are so bold
My wanting to kiss you still is not enough
I'm getting over all the comments
Unfriendly statements made by people are nonsense
I'm getting stronger by the minute
And once I slip into position I'll swing you and turn you all around

You are the sweetest thing I've found since whenever
You're the only way my time is measured
You might be the silent type
But your advertising louder now
It's crazy how you're killing me

But I like your
Red top and matching bottoms
You know the one- the ones you got on
Pull them over your skinny self
But don't cover your tattoo, woo!
'Cause I like to look at you, yeah
I love that smell on you
And I got your special place against this face for tasting too

And I like it natural
No need for chemicals
Sparking up my senses
You're making it sensual
Calling it sexual, mmm

And you're gonna get yours, my lady
Might even be today
And it ain't no thing because I'll be rolling right along with you, ooh

You are the sweetest thing I've found since whenever
You're the only way my time is measured
You might be the silent type
But your advertising louder now
It's crazy how you're killing me

And give us both a break
And to give us back a taste when the way things were before they made the laws
And to give us both a chance
But it won't be the last romance
'Cause when the weekend starts, the guilty party's on

(Scatting)

Weekend- party's over
Don't stop, let's get closer
Friday, got cold shoulder
Monday, got a new composure

Weekend- party's over
Don't stop, let's get lower
I won't blow your cover
Opportunistic lover

Weekend- party's over
Don't stop, let's get closer
Friday's mediocre
Monday, I'm self-exposed now

Weekend- party's over
Don't stop, let's suppose, uh
I won't blow your cover
Opportunistic lover"
Jason Mraz,Please Don't Tell Her,"I hear she's kickin' ass across the board and rock two hundred thousand higher scorer
Just in time to save the world of being taken over
She's a warrior
I couldn't play again because the game it never ended, never even landed on the cannon
And never let me in to spend my quarter
There's no love for me, no more

Say it isn't so
How she easily come, how she easy go
Please don't tell her that I've been meaning to miss her
Because I don't

She was the girl with the broadest shoulders
But she would die before I crawled over them
She is taller than I am
She knew I wouldn't mind the view there
Or the altitude with a mouth full of air
She let me down, the doubt came out until the now became later

Say that it isn't so
How she easily come, how she easy go
Please don't tell her that I've been meaning to miss her
Because I don't, not for her
It's not that I'm mad
To forgive, forget
What I say

That I'm crazy like the rest of us
And I'm crazier when I'm next to her

So why after the all of everything that came and went
I care enough to still be singing of the bitter end and broken eras
I told you I don't
But I am only trying to be the best with my attempt to cure
The rest assured I'll aim to ease the plural hurts of the words
""Reverse psychology""
That's easier said
Easier than done

Please don't dare to tell her what I've become
Please don't mention all the attention I have drawn
Please don't bother 'cause she'll feel guilty when I'm gone (fuck you)

Because I'm crazy like the rest of us
But I'm crazier when I'm next to her
And it's amazing how she's so self-assured
But I know she'd hate me if she knew my words
Do I hurt anymore
Do I hurt? Well,
I don't
I don't
I don't"
Jason Mraz,The Forecast,"Well I heard that it might be raining
Bed sheets and lovers words
Let's throw out the hotel comforter
And hang the do not disturb
Sign me up for storm, I'll wear my suit
For the shower, cause ill have you
To keep me warm in the coldest hour

And when the darkness falls under your head
There I'll be, and crazy is the forecast all week

Well every kiss every hug it's so light on the touch
Delicate like a snowflake
I can taste, I can taste, I can taste, I can taste
You all over my face, and everyone might find me foolish
To not be counting on the sun, but your mouth is my umbrella now
And I'm holding your tongue

And if the rain should fall for sure with you I'll be
And crazy is the forecast all week

And there's a good chance in hell
Like cats and dogs will by flying
And I'm no weather man
But you are lightning, striking

La la
La
Here comes the sun and the rain
All in once, how we sing

In the midst of the morning pull up a blanket of a cloud
And wait for the warning of another come down
Because...
The water is healthy for the roses in your cheeks
My well holds plenty for penny wishing in your deep end
When the lights go out, no doubt with you I'll be

And crazy is the forecast all week

And if the rain should fall for sure with you I'll be
Because crazy is the forecast, all week long
Crazy is the forecast"
Jason Mraz,Song For A Friend,"Well, ""You're magic,"" he said
But don't let it all go to your head
'Cause I bet if you all had it all figured out
Then you'd never get out of bed
No doubt
Of all the things that I've read what he wrote me
Is now sounding like the man I was hoping
To be
I keep on keeping it real
Cause it keeps getting easier, he'll see
He's the reason that I'm laughing
Even if there's no one else
He said, you've got to love yourself

You say, you shouldn't mumble when you speak
But keep your tongue up in your cheek
And if you stumble on to something better
Remember that it's humble that you seek
You got all the skill you need
Individuality
You got something
Call it gumption
Call it anything you want
Because when you play the fool now
You're only fooling everyone else
You're learning to love yourself

Yes you are, you are, it's you...

There's no price to pay (no, no)
When you give and what you take
That's why it's easy to thank you
You, you...
You, you, you...

Let's say take a break from our day
And get ['n] back to the old garage
Because life's too short anyway
But at least it's better then average
As long as you got me
And I got you
You know we've got a lot to go around
I'll be your friend
Your other brother
Another love to come and comfort you-ooh-ooh

And I'll keep reminding
If it's the only thing I ever do-ooh-ooh
I will always love you

You, you, you...
You...
(It's true I love, it's true)
(It's you I love, it's you I love, it's you, it's you I love)
(It's true I love, it's true I love, its true, it's you I love)
(It's you I love, it's you I love, it's you, it's you I love) Oh it's you, it's you I love
Oh, it's you I love

(It's you I love, it's you I love, it's you, it's you I love) Ooh, it's you I love...
(It's true I love, it's true I love, its true, it's you I love)
(It's you I love, it's you I love, it's you, it's you I love) I'm in love in love in love
I'm in love in love in love with you, I'm [in] love with you

It's you I love, I love, I love
It's you I love, I love, I love
It's you I love, I love, I lo-ove, ooh

(x3)
Climb up over the top
Survey the state of the soul
You've got to find out for yourself whether or not you're truly trying
Why not give it a shot?
Shake it, take control and inevitably wind up fighting for yourself
All the strengths you have inside still rising

Climb up over the top
Survey the state of the soul
You've got to find out for yourself whether or not you're truly trying
Why not give it a shot?
Shake it, take control and inevitably wind up
And find out for yourself
All the strengths that you have inside of you"
Jason Mraz,Running,"Running to catch up again, jumping higher and flying more often than not
Your trampoline has got holes in it but I can still see the top
Let me climb aboard and sample some of next year's fashion
I'll wear the coat if you can put the hat on, I will wear the coat,
Just let me clear my throat so I can say what's been delayed aways

Let me fall into your lap and just lay here for awhile
Satisfied by your seduction like a handshake would do the job
Never know how long I have waited, anticipated your smile to be pressed against mine
Your smile pressed against mine, your smile pressed against mine
I feel it, well I feel it (oh boy)
Well I feel it and I'm gonna settle tight

She could pour me over this sugar hill or mountain
Until I get hat cool breeze, tight squeeze, I'd do it over again
And I drink from her ever flowing fountain
And then I wake up I comb my hair and I hurry it up
But I arrive late I pack my things and I pick it up
Well I put down a good amount of deodorant this morning
And I found that I could drown a little bit of peace of mind
'Cause it's no secret that to some degree they're gonna have to see you sweat
Strong enough for a man just do what you can to keep me soft and dry, I stink awhile

I don't know anything about those things
I almost don't wanna know anything about those things
And I don't care anything about those things
'Cause if I did you know I'd share myself on those things, and I feel it

And I'll be here all night, I'll pick up the pieces and I put them back together now
They may not be the right way but that's okay as long as they're all the same
I wish you well that you'd get better, and I know you'll find that it's a wild world
And if you had noticed well would you have thrown the towel in
Before I missed out on all this love, and watch me roll away again
Watch me disappear under my skin
I don't believe it that things could get any worse than they did that time
You must have seen it I mean how could we get lost running in a straight line
Your cries of why's and why not's, may it all get back to you
And trickle and dance upon your headaches, years of biting cheeks are through
So I don't believe in it.

But I feel it."
Jason Mraz,Did I Fool Ya?,"Daddy songs he's an auctioneer
And mother clings to anniversary years
And the sister she got a little bit of mister in her
And the brothers going round around his bed

And I say, did I fool ya?
Didn't daddy fool ya?
He go once, he going twice He go for 35 or 40
He go once, he going twice He go for 45 or 50
He go once, he going twice He go 55 or maybe he will make it up
To 65
He go once, he going twice Ain't it nice price wise?
I gotta a nice life for the price

I give and give and I lay it all down
Look what I found I give and give
I give and give and I lay it all down
Look what I found, look what I found
Blue skies they're smiling at me

And that's my favorite melody
But I can't read I can't read
I can't read between the things unseen
And I don't mind I don't mind
I don't mind if I don't find because I tried

I'm absolutely definite absolutely positive
Absolutely definitely positive
I'm absolutely definite absolutely positive
Absolutely definitely positively representative

So why the bother with it
Did I fool ya? Or didn't daddy fool ya?
He go once, he going twice He go for 35 or 40
He go once, he going twice He go for 45 or 50
He go once, he going twice He go 55 or maybe he will make it up
To 65
He go once, he going twice
Ain't it nice price wise?"
Jason Mraz,Little You & I,"You close your eyes
You say goodnight in your own special way
You rest your head and you rest your mind
And there you go

There you go so fast, so fast asleep
There you are without a care when or where
But there you are I swear without a care where it is you lay

Spiraling spaces tangled up in moments of touching time
Trying to find some somewhere sleeping sideways
Pockets full of nothing, head exploding from the mind
Too much time for dancing in our hair
Sister don't be shy between little you and I

Mouths in line, tears beside
And we're gonna weep in between the sleep
Until we float away into broken promises
Too much, too hard to keep

And we would sell our souls to the devil if he promised us hell
It's something we already know so well
And it's right on, right on the tip of our tongue
Something big that has already begun
(Something dead but not quite numb)
And I'm singing it

Mouths in line, tears beside
And we're gonna weep in between the sleep
Until we float away into broken promises
Too much, too hard to keep"
Jason Mraz,You & I Both,"Was it you who spoke the words that things would happen but not to me
Oh things are gonna happen naturally
Oh taking your advice and I'm looking on the bright side
And balancing the whole thing

Oh but at often times those words get tangled up in lines
And the bright light turns to night
Oh until the dawn it brings
Another day to sing about the magic that was you and me

'Cause you and I both loved
What you and I spoke of
And others just read of
Others only read of the love
Oh the love that I love
La la la la

See I'm all about them words
Over numbers, unencumbered numbered words
Hundreds of pages, pages, pages for words
More words than I had ever heard
And I feel so alive

'Cause you and I both loved
What you and I spoke of
And others just read of
And if you could see me now
Oh love, love

You and I you and I
Not so little you and I any more
And with this silence brings a moral story
More importantly evolving
Is the glory of a boy

'Cause you and I both loved
What you and I spoke of
And others just read of
And if you could see me now
Well then I'm almost finally out of
I'm finally out of
Finally de de de de de de de,
Well I'm almost finally, finally,
Well I am free, oh, I'm free

And it's okay
If you had to go away
Oh just remember the telephones
Well they work in both ways
(Additional lyrics from live version:
And the more you follow through,
There's always more left over,
And not too much explaining to do.
And if ever you find your love,
I will be your lifeline,
I will never miss your phonecall)
But if I never, ever hear them ring
If nothing else
I'll think the bells inside have finally found you someone else
And that's okay
'Cause I'll remember everything you sang

'Cause you and I both loved
What you and I spoke of
And others just read of
And if you could see me now
Well then I'm almost finally out of
I'm finally out of, finally de de de de de de de de,
Well I'm almost finally, finally,
Out of words."
Jason Mraz,1000 Things,"And I'm, I'm over-joyed
And I'm, I'm over-loved
And I'm feeling lucky like a little boy
Who's hiding under cover
And looking to discover
Every way to play the part inside this darkened cave
The meaning of life, well it starts at the night light
Close your eyes and I hope you see mine

And I've, well I've seen a thousand things in one place
But I stopped my counting when I saw your face
Erasing memory, well I feel as though I've never seen a face before
Until I saw your eyes
And they're smiling back at me through my tears
I've been counting all these years, oh 
Suddenly the thousand things I've seen were nothing more than dreams of
Of you and me
You and me
Quietly at a standstill now
Fortunately you will, well you'll kiss me, I will
I will kiss you back

Oh the fact of the matter is
And I don't know what the latter is, oh no way
See, I've always wanted to kiss you
But I, I always wanted to run from you
Because I've always wanted to miss you
And I, I always wanted to comfort you

Well I love my comfort foods, you said
While you always say, How do you do?"
Jason Mraz,Unfold,"Hands in line
Arms close to my side
I'm fighting tides
Of an ocean's undertows
And I figure that I might not make it out
I'm taking empty
But seldom speaking
And a words retreat
Yeah they breathing histories still at ease
Into stories untold
And my arms unfold

My hands are high
And I'm holding on
Holding on
And I figured that I
I figured that I just might make it
And I'm waking empty
But seldom sleeping
And the words repeat, breathing histories into stories untold
And I unfold

Quality isn't what you see now
In the corner of your eyes
And don't be surprised
If you here the bells ring as they fall from the skyline
They sound: bong bong bong bong
But ah yeah yeah yeah
Bong bong bong bong but ah yeah yeah yeah
Oh oh I
And in the night I'm always holding up
Holding up holding up
I'm holding up this time
I'm holding up this time
'Cause I figure that I
I figure that I just might make it

And I'm waking empty
But seldom sleeping
And the words repeat
Breathing histories and the stories untold
But I unfold"
Jason Mraz,Halfway Home,"Well I used to walk along the opposite side of the road
And made others get out of my way
I used to think that I could sit and wait for the times
But I know I should meet them halfway

I'm halfway home and I'm on my own
I'm halfway there and I don't care, I don't mind
I plan to leave here after supper time
That's when traffic is light, all I need is a sign
And I'll be all right. I'll be fine

Well I used to think that I could just sleep and then I would dream
And everything it would just come to me
Until I woke one day without anything to eat
Lying on the opposite side of the street

I'm halfway home and I'm still out on my own
I'm halfway there and I don't care, I don't mind
Because it ain't my time not to stay or say
Well I can't say, but you can bet that I will play my heart out
I'll won't lay.

I used to think that I could just sit and wait for the times
But I know I gotta meet them somewhere out there halfway

I'm halfway home I tried running with the flow
I'm halfway there. Ain't it funny how everybody seems to care
I planned to get there around supper time their serving up bread and wine
All I needed was a sign and I guess I'll be all right.
I'll be fine.
I'll be fine.
I'll be all right.
I'll be all right.

(It seems to be a running theme about being fine and all right but I don't mind)
Because I'll be fine and all right
I'll be fine
I'll be fine"
Jason Mraz,Bright Eyes,"Bright lights, big city
Was quite extraordinary
The drive was pretty
I was in perfect company
The love of a lifetime
Since we were elementary friends
The one with the bright eyes

Why can't I be optimistic
I tried to find the logic logically
I had a dream and I could not shake it
I was standing up there naked

There's fear in the truth at hand, frozen I forgot to understand
The live keep living growing older more into a man
And I let her grow away from me

Love love is not pretending
Time time was meant for mending
Memories into all is satisfactory
Healthy smiles fill the page the day we spent in miles
And I let her drive away from me

The one with the bright eyes
Laughed her way inside this music box
Stored away in the corner of my heart And I let her get away from me
But I'll never take that day away from me"
Jason Mraz,After An Afternoon,"I bare my windowed self untamed and untrained
Dreams that hardly touch our complexions truest faults
If room enough for both my drowsy spirit shall fall
Bold waves tumble oh to the season of my heart
And you have offended my faith and my trust
Until all is lost into the beauty of the day
Until all is lost, until all is lost

But there's something in the way you laugh
And it makes me feel like a child
Aspects of life they confuse me
You and your thesis amuse me
Oh, after and afternoon with you
And your rich brown eyes
Your lips and dark hair
Elbows and exposed knees tossing toward the ceiling
After an after, after an after, after an afternoon
After an after, after an afternoon with you

Face to palm
Tear to tear
Mouth to tongue
Heart to ground
Heart to ground
Heart to ground
I am in love"
Jason Mraz,Conversation With Myself,"Crazy, now what'cha doing?
Just the same, well I think I'm right
Crazy how fast you're moving
As our friendship pays for your lonely night

This is a conversation with myself

It's okay to dance around it and have it your way
Laugh about it, oh for goodness sake
Don't believe in anything that's keeping you awake

I'm feeling all sentimental and feeling all through my head
I'm feeling all very sexual but feeling all by myself instead

This is a conversation with myself

It's okay to dance around it and have it your way
Laugh about it, oh for goodness sake
Don't believe in anything that's keeping you awake
Loverboy, lovergirl, 
You need a song to sleep to and morning to sleep through
And have it your way.

You better have it your way with yourself.
You better have it your way anytime.
You better have it you way with yourself and only yourself
You better have it yours and baby you know that I'll have mine."
Jason Mraz,Common Pleasure,"Said will I,
I remember when we used to walk together,
Used to talk together, Go to the park together,
In all of kinds of weather we would share,
This common pleasure, with most of human kinds,
It was a kind of treasure, one I was surely glad to find,
And I got some right here, And I'm okay, I'm okay
You're okay, ha ha, we're okay, ha ha ooha I am all right,
I answered all right, I'm doin' fine, but oh bones again are broken,
The love is not a token of affection, It's not even a real thing,
It's a word, so don't try to buy it out with a ring,
'Cause it's a verb, to love someone, open up and let them in,
Just don't, just don't be afraid, don't be afraid to set them again,
This ain't no heaven, ain't no hell, ain't no in-between,
'Cause there's just too many faces and places in this world,
That I ain't never seen, I'm gonna keep on keeping on on,
I'm gonna reap on being strong, and I got my head on,

Though misconnected, its all right 'cause I do it protected,
I got a day job, I drive a cheap ride, Sounds like I'm gonna be fine,
You only get one life to learn, There's only so many brain cells you can burn,
An' life can take a turn, and take away everything that you've earned,
And leave you yearnin' for more more more,
Life is gonna leave you yearnin' for more more more,
Your stomach gonna be churnin' wantin' more,
You wantin' wantin' some more, you wantin' some more,
Do you want some?
Do you want some?
Then I got some,
Um (a bunch of times),
Well I got one right here,
And I'm okay, I'm okay,
And you're okay, ha ha, we're okay, ha ha ooha I am all right.
I answered all right, I'm doin' fine."
Jason Mraz,Zero Percent,"Our friends on the front porch and they telling the jokes and they
Swinging oh-so-swiftly towards happier times
Expending lines and finding more energy for the effort
And getting distance from that front porch spotlight

But us, we found peace in the shadows
Long enough to see the monsters rise
And Candy's got some space to fill in her daydreams
Living high on yesterday's lies
And talking to me about some zero percent interest
And how she got a better deal than the next guy, oh my God
And the way the lightning shocked us, oh, when we were lost
Around that long deserted highway
Well, our hair was longer then, and now I can remember
Say, now well I remember oh-so-well
Almost too well, now

Oh, the roads unencumbered by cats
They're burning like wet matches through my miracle mile mind
But it's all in my mind
You left your thumb print inside me now for months it seems
But mine only brushes your soft surface
And somehow, somehow it leaves me listless
My tongue curls under my lips, oh, oh yes

So I can speak to tell you of the months before I met you, love
Oh, true love
And the way the truth it locked us
Right about the time after the lightning it shocked us
When we were young, when we were young and missing
'Round that small New England byway
Our lives they were sheltered then and I can remember
And I remember well, so well
It's almost too well

Well, it's not even being about that anymore
I gotta get you down
Those tiny fragments of perfection
They please me in a time unchanged
But it's all the same beginning
And it's a long awaited end

If I knew all the words I would write myself out of here
If I was all the colors I would paint you pretty in gold in a picture
So I'm told, little sister

So now I'm sold, little sister
Why don't you tell me about the sunsets in Sweden
And the laws of Eden
And how you were the rock of Gibraltar
And how they called you foxy? (foxy)
Well that's another whole box of Pandora's
That's another whole box of them ties

Slide your foot off the gas before we crash
Right back into the median
Right back into into the median, the median
Oh lord, it separates
Our house from the middle of the street
Our house

(All right that's your part this time
Here we go say it)

Our house (Ah, that's nice) from the middle of the street
Our house

(Aright I'm gonna give it to Toca this time
Oh, okay we're doing this still)

Our house from the middle of the street

(Uh! Damn, I got a powerhouse back here
Hey, they're not making up for the rest of you
You're gonna, uh, okay)

(K, only the sexy people)

Our house from the middle of the street

(Okay, only the horny people)

Our house from the middle of the street

(Only the sweaty people, ah
You guys aren't sweaty?)

Our house from the middle of the street

(One more time for the sex-heads)

Our house from the middle of the street
Our house, our house

(In Spanish)

Mi casa in del medio de la calle

(One more time, here we go)

Mi casa in del medio de la calle
Oh, mi casa, mi casa, mi casa, su casa
Our house

Is on the front porch telling jokes and they
Swinging oh-so-swiftly towards happier times
They expending all those lines and finding more energy for the effort
And getting distance from that front porch spotlight
But us we found the peace in all of the shadows
Oh, long enough to see the monster die
Oh, long enough to see the monster die
Oh, long enough, is it long enough?
Is it long enough, is it long enough for me?

Well, if it isn't, and if it isn't
And if it isn't, and if it isn't
If it ain't ain't, and if it don't
Well, if it can't, then it won't

Well, if it isn't, and if it isn't
And if it isn't, and if it isn't
If it ain't ain't, and if it don't
Well, if it can't, then it won't
And that's just way it goes

Jason Mraz,Hey Love,"(Ba dah bum bum bum, ba dah buh da bums)

Stay, Hey love, where you going to?
You're not sleeping anymore, you're just trying to.
Hey, Stay love, where you running to?
Awful happens all the time, don't let it kill you.

I said easily with me I feel as fast as I can see...
Just afraid of all the horror stories I fall down on my knees.

Come away, come away
From all these things unheard
If a chosen word has got you cornered
Then it's a lesson learned
Like close the book before it burns you now

Come away, come away
From all these things unseen
At the price you paid I promise you won't believe anything they say
Belief will only disappoint you now

Well in case you never noticed the path you never chose has chosen you.
Don't be afraid to face and break it, your secrets safe
Don't be afraid to face and break it, your secret stays, stays, stayin'

Hey, Hey Love, where ya goin', ya goin' to?
Your not sleeping, your not sleeping here, no not
Hey Love, Hey Love, Hey Love,
Where you running to?
Awful happens all the time, try not to let it kill you.

Jason Mraz,Make It Mine,"Wake up everyone
How can you sleep at a time like this
Unless the dreamer is the real you
Listen to your voice
The one that tells you to taste past the tip of your tongue
Leap and the net will appear

I don't wanna wake before
The dream is over
I'm gonna make it mine
Yes I... I know it
I'm gonna make it mine
Yes I'll make it all mine

I keep my life on a heavy rotation
Requesting that it's lifting you up
Up up and away
And over to a table at the gratitude cafe

And I am finally there
And all the angels they'll be singing
Ah la la la ah la la la I la la la la love this

Well I don't wanna break before
The tour is over
I'm gonna make it mine
Yes I... I'm alone and
I'm gonna make it mine
Yes I'll make it all mine

Timing's everything
And this time there's plenty
I am balancing
Careful and steady
And reveling in energy that everyone's emitting

Well I don't wanna wait no more
Oh I wanna celebrate the whole world
I'm gonna make it mine
Oh yes, I'm following your joy
I'm gonna make it mine
Because I... I am open
I'm gonna make it mine
That's right... I will show it
I'm gonna make it all mine
Gonna make, gonna make, gonna make, gonna make it, make it, make it mine
All mine
Yes I'll make it all mine"
Jason Mraz,I'm Yours,"Well, you done done me and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
Now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out I'll be giving it my bestest
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Well, open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find love love, love, love
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing
We're just one big family
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved, love, love, loved, loved

So I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait I'm sure
There's no need to complicate
Our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours

Do you want to, come on
Scooch on over closer dear
And I will nibble your ear

I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed

I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours
So please don't please don't please don't
There's no need to complicate
'Cause our time is short
This oh this oh this is our fate I'm yours

Oh I'm yours, oh I'm yours, oh
Baby, do believe I'm yours
You best believe, you best believe I'm yours"
Jason Mraz,Lucky,"Do you hear me? I'm talking to you
Across the water across the deep blue ocean
Under the open sky oh my, baby I'm trying
Boy I hear you in my dreams
I feel your whisper across the sea
I keep you with me in my heart
You make it easier when life gets hard

Lucky I'm in love with my best friend
Lucky to have been where I have been
Lucky to be coming home again

They don't know how long it takes
Waiting for a love like this
Every time we say goodbye
I wish we had one more kiss
I wait for you I promise you I will

Lucky I'm in love with my best friend
Lucky to have been where I have been
Lucky to be coming home again
Lucky we're in love in every way
Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed
Lucky to be coming home someday

And so I'm sailing through the sea
To an island where we'll meet
You'll hear the music, fill the air
I'll put a flower in your hair
And though the breeze is through the trees
Move so pretty you're all I see
As the world keeps spinning round
You hold me right here right now

Lucky I'm in love with my best friend
Lucky to have been where I have been
Lucky to be coming home again
Lucky we're in love every way
Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed
Lucky to be coming home someday"
Jason Mraz,Butterfly,"Taking a moment just imagining that I'm dancing with you
I'm your pole and all you're wearing is your shoes
You've got soul, you know what to do to turn me on until I write a song about you
And you have your own engaging style, you've got the knack to vivify
And you make my slacks a little tight, you may unfasten them if you like
That's if you crash and spend the night

But you don't bode, you don't pay, you got everything you need
Especially me, sister you've got it all
You make the call to make my day
In your message say my name
Your talk is all the talk, sister you've got it all

Curl your upper lip up and let me look around
Ride your tongue along your bottom lip and bite down
And bend your back and ask those hips if I can touch
Well they're the perfect jumping up point
Getting closer to your butterfly

You float on by
Oh kiss me with your eyelashes tonight
Or Eskimo your nose real close to mine
And let's mood the lights and finally make it right

But you don't bode and you don't pay, you got everything you need
Especially me, sister you've got it all
You make the call to make my day
In your message say my name
Your talk is all the talk, sister you've got it all

You've got it all, you've got it all, you've got it all
You've got it all, you've got it all, you've got it all

You've got it all

Don't I need to see you pull your knee socks up
Let me feel you upside down, slide in, slide out
Slide over here, climb into my mouth now

Butterfly
Well you landed on my mind
Damn right you, landed on my ear and then you crawled inside
And now I see you perfectly behind closed eyes
I wanna fly with you
And I don't want to lie to you

'Cause I can't recall a better day
Sun coming to shine on the occasion
You're an open-minded lady, you've got it all
And I never forget a face
If I could make you my own, I have my days
The fact is, it's you who've got it all to make my day
In your message say my name
Your talk is all the talk, sister you've got it all

You know that fortune favors the brave
But let me get paid while I make you breakfast
The rest is up to you, you makes the call
You make the call to make my day
In your message say my name
It's you who's got it all

I can't recall a better day
Sun coming to shine on the occasion
You're a sophisticated lady, you've got it all

You've got it all, you've got it all, you've got it all
You've got it all, you've got it all, you've got it all
You've got it all, you've got it all, you've got it all
You've got it all, you've got it all, you've got it all

Butterfly, baby, you've got it all"
Jason Mraz,Live High,"I try to picture the girl
Through a looking glass
And see her as a carbon atom
See her eyes and stare back at them
See that girl
As her own new world
Though a home is on the surface, she is still a universe

Glory God, oh God is peeking through the blinds
Are we all here standing naked
Taking guesses at the actual date and time
Oh my, justifying reasons why
Is an absolutely insane resolution to live by

Live high, live mighty
Live righteously
Takin' it easy
Live high, live mighty
Live righteously

I try to picture the man
To always have an open hand
And see him as a giving tree
See him as matter
Matter fact he's not a beast
Oh no not the devil either
Always a good deed doer
And it's laughter that we're making after all

The call of the wild is still an ordination why
And the order of the primates
All our politics are too late
Oh my, the congregation in my mind
Is this assembly singing of gratitude
Practicing their lovin' for you

Live high, live mighty
Live righteously
Takin' it easy
Live high, live mighty
Ooh... live righteously

And sing it out...
And just take it easy
And celebrate the malleable reality
You see nothing is ever as it seems
Yeah, this life is but a dream

Live high, live high, live mighty mighty mighty, ooh...
Live righteously
And takin' it easy

Live high, live mighty
Ooh... live righteously
Just take, just just, take it easy

Live high, live mighty mighty
Live righteously
Takin' it easy

Live high, live mighty
Live righteously
Let's take it easy"
Jason Mraz,Love For A Child,"There's a picture on my kitchen wall
Looks like Jesus and his friends involved
There's a party getting started in the yard
There's a couple getting steamy in the car parked in the drive
Was I too young to see this with my eyes?

By the pool last night, apparently
The chemicals weren't mixed properly
You hit your head and then forgot your name
And then you woke up at the bottom by the drain
And now your altitude and memory's a shame

What about taking this empty cup and filling it up
With a little bit more of innocence
I haven't had enough, it's probably because when you're young
It's okay to be easily ignored
I like to believe it was all about love for a child

And when the house was left in shambles
Who was there to handle all the broken bits of glass
Was it mom who put my dad out on his ass or the other way around
Well I'm far too old to care about that now

What about taking this empty cup and filling it up
With a little bit more of innocence
I haven't had enough, it's probably because when you're young
It's okay to be easily ignored
I'd like to believe it was all about love for a child

It's kinda nice to work the floor since the divorce
I've been enjoying both my Christmases and my birthday cakes
And taking drugs and making love at far too young an age
And they never check to see my grades
What a fool I'd be to start complaining now

What about taking this empty cup and filling it up
With a little bit more of innocence
I haven't had enough, it's probably because when you're young
It's okay to be easily ignored
I'd love to believe it's all about love for a child

It was all about love..."
Jason Mraz,Details in the Fabric (feat. James Morrison),"Calm down
Deep breaths
And get yourself dressed instead
Of running around
And pulling all your threads saying
Breaking yourself up

If it's a broken part, replace it
If it's a broken arm then brace it
If it's a broken heart then face it

And hold your own
Know your name
And go your own way
Hold your own
Know your own name
And go your own way

And everything will be fine

Hang on
Help is on the way
Stay strong
I'm doing everything

Hold your own
Know your name
And go your own way
Hold your own
Know your name
And go your own way

And everything, everything will be fine
Everything

Are the details in the fabric
Are the things that make you panic
Are your thoughts results of static cling?

Are the things that make you blow
Hell, no reason, go on and scream
If you're shocked it's just the fault
Of faulty manufacturing.

Yeah everything will be fine
Everything in no time at all
Everything

Hold your own
And know your name
And go your own way

Are the details in the fabric (Hold your own, know your name)
Are the things that make you panic
Are your thoughts results of static cling? (Go your own way)

Are the details in the fabric (Hold your own, know your name)
Are the things that make you panic (Go your own way)
Is it Mother Nature's sewing machine?

Are the things that make you blow (Hold your own, know your name)
Hell no reason go on and scream
If you're shocked it's just the fault (Go your own way)
Of faulty manufacturing

Everything will be fine
Everything in no time at all
Hearts will hold"
Jason Mraz,Coyotes,"I'm sipping coffee at a quarter to two
Awake and I'm dialing and my mind's running to you
No wonder I'm a one-woman man
She keeps my heart in a jar in a nightstand
I should tell her that she couldn't be more
Opposite than a foot in the door
There's no one else I would rather go out with
It's hell when I see them standing there
Me and my mouth we don't mean to be rushing
We talk about thee freely 'cause we crushing
I'm gonna shake both sides of the butt, yeah
Theoretically yes ain't we lucky

And when the coyotes they sing in the park
That's when the city life starts falling for the sea
Winding roads are winding down
And the flying men will hit the ground
Every notion is closer to touching
The coyotes sing when they call on your loving

We're coming back for more
You know why, we're coming for you
You know we should be
We should be together
Cause once we rock, we won't wanna stop
Not today or tomorrow
(Not today or tomorrow, oh no)
You better lock your doors
You know why, 'cause we want you
'Cause we like you alotta

I wish the wild was alive like you
I wish the wind would blow me through
Another opportunity to approach you
Another telepathic rendezvous
I wish you well with your weapon of jargon
You've got a double sided lexicon
I gotta try to keep your attention
Gotta write using less emoticons
Gotta figure out the snooze alarm
I wanna lay in your place till dawn
I wanna play in the park, come on
Now let me see your other upper echelon

And when the coyotes escape to New York
Then the city life has crumbled to the sea
And the girls will fall to the lost and found
The flying men will hit the ground
Every notion is closer to touching
The coyotes sing when they feast on your loving
I'm a coyote and I got a taste for your loving

We're coming back for more
You know why, we're coming for you
You know we should be
We should be together
Because once we rock, we won't wanna stop
Not today or tomorrow
(Not today or tomorrow, oh no)
Because once we rock, we won't wanna stop
Not today or tomorrow
We're coming back for more
You know why, we're coming for you
You know we should be
We should be together
Cause once we rock, we won't wanna stop
Not today or tomorrow"
Jason Mraz,Only Human,"A squirrel in the tree is he watching me
Does he give a damn?
Does he care who I am?
I'm just a man, is that all I am
Are my manners misinterpreted words or only human?
I'm human

Murderous crow, hey what you know
What you reading about, what you hold in your toes
Is that a twig, are you a dove of peace
A black dove undercover, with another puzzle piece
Are you a riddle to solve all along?
Or am I over thinking thoughts of human after all

Only human
Made of flesh, made of sand, made of human
The planet's talking about a revolution
The natural laws ain't got no constitution
They've got a right to live their own life
But we keep paving over paradise

'Cause we're only human
Yes we are, only human
If it's our only excuse do you think we'll keep on being only human
Yes we are, yes we are
Only human, only human, only human
So far...

Up in the major's tree, the one he planted back when he was just a boy
Back in 1923
Thirty meters and a foot, take a look, take a climb
What you'll find is the product of a seed
The seed is sown, all alone
It grows above, with a heart of love
Sharp and shelter of the animals of land and cold weather breathing
We're all breathing

The planet's talking about a revolution
The natural laws ain't got no constitution
They've got a right to live their own life
But we keep paving over paradise

'Cause we're only human
Oh yes we are, only human
If it's our only excuse do you think we'll keep on being only human
Yes we are, only human, only human, so far, so far

And this place it will outlive me
Before I get to heaven I'll climb that tree
And I will have to give my thanks
For giving me the branch to swing on
If I ever fall in love
I'll have to give myself a baby
I will let my children have their way

'Cause we're only human, yes we are
Only human, so far, so far"
Jason Mraz,The Dynamo Of Volition,"I've got the dynamo of volition
With po-pole position
Automatic transmission with lo-ow emissions
I'm a brand new addition to the old edition
With the love unconditional.

I'm a drama abolitionist
Damn no opposition to my proposition
Half of a man, half magician
Half a politician holding the mic
Like ammunition
And my vision is as simple as light.

Ain't no reason we should be in a fight
No demolition
Get to vote, get to say what you like
Procreation
Compositions already written by themselves
Heck is for the people not believin' in gosh

Good job
Get 'em up way high
Gimme gimme that high five
Good time
Get 'em way down low
Gimme gimme that low dough
Good God
Bring 'em back again
Gimme gimme that high ten
You're the best definition of good intentions.

I do not answer a call if
I do not know who is calling
I guess the whole point of it all is
That we never know really

I'm tryin' to keep with the Joneses
While waiting for guns and the roses
To finish what we all suppose is
Gonna be the shit.
That's silly

Oh, fist like pumpin' and wrist lock
Twisting up a Rizla
Kid Icarus on the transistor
Nintendo givin' me the blister
I bend over take it in the kisser

Best friends are hittin' on my sister.
Try to tell them that they still wish-a
'Cause she already got herself a mister
And besides that's gross to wanna diss her
Didn't I say - didn't I say

Good job
Get 'em up way high
Gimme gimme that high five
Good time
Get 'em way down low
Gimme gimme that low dough
Good God
Bring 'em back again
Gimme gimme that high ten
You're the best definition of good versus evil

I do not keep up with statistics
I do not sleep without a mistress
I do not eat unless it's fixed with
Some kind of sweet like a licorice
My home is deep inside the mystics
I'm known to keep diggin' on existence
I'm holdin' in the heat like a fish stick
My phone it beeps because I missed it.

I do not answer the call if
I do not know who is calling
I'm makin' no sense of it all
Say can I get a witness?

I'm only a boy in a story
Just a hallucinatory
Trippin' on nothing there is
Living in the wilderness

With a tiger spot on my back
Living life of a cat
I just wanna relax here
And write another rap tune
Driving off your blind man's bike
You can say just what you like
But nothing can stop you

Good job
Get 'em up way high
Gimme gimme that high five
Good time
Get 'em way down low
Gimme gimme that low dough
Good time
Bring 'em back again
Gimme gimme that high ten
You're the best definition of good intentions"
Jason Mraz,If It Kills Me,"Hello, tell me you know
Yeah, you figured me out
Something gave it away
It would be such a beautiful moment
To see the look on your face
To know that I know that you know now

And baby that's a case of my wishful thinking
You know nothing
Well you and I
Why, we go carrying on for hours, on and
We get along much better
Than you and your boyfriend

Well all I really wanna do is love you
A kind much closer than friends use
But I still can't say it after all we've been through
And all I really want from you is to feel me
As the feeling inside keeps building
And I will find a way to you if it kills me
If it kills me

How long, can I go on like this,
Wishing to kiss you,
Before I rightly explode?
Well this double life I lead isn't healthy for me
In fact it makes me nervous
If I get caught I could be risking it all

Cause maybe there's a lot that I miss
In case I'm wrong

All I really wanna do is love you
A kind much closer than friends use
But still can't say it after all we've been through
And all I really want from you is to feel me
As the feeling inside keeps building
And I will find a way to you if it kills me
If it kills me
If it kills me

If I should be so bold
I'd ask you to hold my heart in your hand
I'd tell you from the start how I longed to be your man
But I never said a word
I guess I gonna miss my chance again

Well all I really wanna do is love you
A kind much closer than friends use
I still can't say it after all we've been through
And all I really want from you is to feel me
As the feeling inside keeps building
And I will find a way to you if it kills me
If it kills me
If it kills me
Oh, I think it might kill me

And all I really want from you is to feel me
It's a feeling inside that keeps building
And I will find a way to you if it kills me
If it kills me
If it kills me
It might kill me"
Jason Mraz,A Beautiful Mess,"You've got the best of both worlds
You're the kind of girl who can take down a man,
And lift him back up again
You are strong but you're needy,
Humble but you're greedy
Based on your body language,
Your shouted cursive I've been reading
Your style is quite selective,
Though your mind is rather reckless
Well I guess it just suggests
That this is just what happiness is

And what a beautiful mess this is
Well it's like picking up trash in dresses

Well it kind of hurts when the kind of words you write
Kind of turn themselves into knives
And don't mind my nerve you could call it fiction
But I like being submerged in your contradictions dear
'Cause here we are, here we are

Although you are biased I love your advice
Your comebacks they're quick
And probably have to do with your insecurities
There's no shame in being crazy,
Depending on how you take these
Words I'm paraphrasing this relationship we're staging

And what a beautiful mess this is
It's like, picking up trash in dresses

Well it kind of hurts when the kind of words you say
Kind of turn themselves into blades
Kind and courteous is a life I've heard
But it's nice to say that we played in the dirt
Oh dear, cause here we are,
Here we are Here we are
Here we are, Here we are...
Here we are, We're still here

What a beautiful mess this is
It's like taking a guess when the only answer is yes
And through timeless words
And priceless pictures
We'll fly like birds
Not of this earth
And tides they turn
And hearts disfigure
But that's no concern
When we're wounded together
And we've torn our dresses
And stained our shirts
But it's nice today

Oh the wait was so worth it"
Jason Mraz,Rise,Instrumental
Jason Mraz,Love Someone,"Love is a funny thing
Whenever I give it, it comes back to me
And it's wonderful to be
Giving with my whole heart
As my heart receives
Your love

Oh, ain't it nice tonight we've got each other
And I am right beside you
More than just a partner or a lover
I'm your friend

When you love someone
Your heartbeat beats so loud
When you love someone
Your feet can't feel the ground

Shining stars all seem
To congregate around your face
When you love someone
It comes back to you

And love is a funny thing
It's making my blood flow with energy
And it's like an awakened dream
As what I've been wishing for, is happening
And it's right on time

Oh ain't it nice this life, we've got each other
And I am right beside you
More than just a partner or a lover
I'm your friend

When you love someone
Your heartbeat beats so loud
When you love someone
Your feet can't feel the ground

Shining stars all seem
To congregate around your face
When you love someone
When you love someone

We're gonna give ourselves to love tonight
Lifting up to touch the starlight
And we will savor every second
We suspend together
You and I will
You and I will
You and I will

When you love someone
Your heartbeat beats so loud
When you love someone
Your feet can't feel the ground

Shining stars all seem
To congregate around your face
When you love someone
It comes back to you"
Jason Mraz,"Hello, You Beautiful Thing","Fall out of bed and catch a fading star
Fancy I woke up before my alarm
Brought my mind through my eyes
It's the best I can do
Before it's automatic, hand it over, turn it to you
Though her smile when it happened, almost as if it was magic
It means there's a god somewhere and he's laughing
And I shuffle my slipperiness toes to the kitchen
Still low to the ground, but high on living

And I know, I know, it's gonna be a good day
Hello, hello, you beautiful thing

Waking up, I stretch my body and acknowledge some aches
It must be something I did yesterday
Pour a cup of liquid gold, 'cause my engine's still cold
And in a minute everything's gonna change

'Cause I know, I know, it's gonna be a good day
Hello, hello, you beautiful thing

Yes I know, I know, it's gonna be a good day
Hello, hello, you beautiful thing

Looking out from a cul de sac watching the band of the Earth take the plaque of the night from the dirt
I can see from the depths of my readjustinize of reflection of yes's and that ever changing sky
But why do bad dreams linger long after I awake?
And I feel quite foolish sometimes when I pray
But my thoughts are all I've got so I try to make them brave

And I know, I know, it's gonna be a good day
Hello, hello, you beautiful thing
Hello, hello, you beautiful thing
I say, hello, hello, you beautiful thing

Oh now this is what I've been waiting for (this is what I've been waiting for)
Oh this is what I've been waiting for (this is what I've been waiting for)
Oh this is what I've been waiting for (this is what I've been waiting for)
Oh this is what I've been waiting for (hello)

Hello, hello, you beautiful thing..."
Jason Mraz,Long Drive,"Long drive, long night
The best night, of my life
With you, ridin'
Your hand on my hand

The thought, of arriving
Kinda feels like dying
I don't want, to go home
And be, alone

Could we, stay out
Could you, drive a little slower
Don't matter where we're going
As long as I'm with you
We can take the long way

Chevy, nova
Front seat, sofa
Getting, closer
To you

Drive a little slower
Don't matter where we're going
As long as I'm with you
We can take the long way

Drive a little slower
Not ready to go home
I rather stay with you
We can take the long way out

To the country, out of town
Let's get lost, I don't want to be found
Let's get away, now

And be careful not to crash
It's known to frost and we're steaming the glass
You hit the road, have a generous shoulder
We could pull over
And say we took the long way

Headlights
Strobe lights
I can see you
But not quite
I can feel you
Inside
The timing is
Just right
The moment
I don't want
To go home
Take the long way out
Take the long way out

Drive a little slower
Don't matter where we're going
Drive a little slower
Don't matter where we're going now
Drive a little slower
Not ready to go home
I'd rather stay with you
We can take the long way

Long drive, long night
The best night of my life"

How could I fall for you?
If I wasn't a songbird
How could I call to you?
If I wasn't a fly on the wall
I wouldn't know all about you

I'm everything in everywhere
Can you see me in your own reflection?
I'm deep within the molecules of the air that you breathe
And all the subatomic supersonic spaces in between
I'm everywhere
I'm reaching out in every direction
I believe I'm in the water too
'Cause you act just like you need me
I'm everywhere

If I wasn't the fire
How could you stoke me up inside?
If I wasn't a party
How could you be the life of me?
If I wasn't a camera
How could you be so photogenic? Yeah I said it
If I wasn't the hands on the clock
How could you know that the time was right, tonight?

I'm everything in everywhere
Can you see me in your own reflection?
I'm deep within the molecules of the air that you breathe
And all the subatomic supersonic spaces in between
I'm everywhere
I'm reaching out in every direction
I believe I'm in the water too
'Cause you act just like you need me

I got a mind like a spy on a satellite checking you out
I'm like a fly with my infinite eyes
I can see with all my senses and I'm coming to get you
I'm invisible, expendable
And omnipresent

I'm everywhere
Can you see me in your own reflection?
I'm deep within the molecules of the air that you breathe
And all the subatomic supersonic spaces in between
I'm everywhere
I'm reaching out in every direction
I believe I'm in the water too
'Cause you act just like you need me
I'm everywhere
I'm everywhere
I'm everywhere
I'm everywhere"
Jason Mraz,Best Friend,"Love is where this begins
Thank you for letting me in
You've always known where I stand
I've never had to pretend
And I feel my life is better
Because you're a part of it
I know without you by my side
That I would be different

Thank you for all of your trust
Thank you for not giving up
Thank you for holding my hand
You've always known where I stand
And I feel my life is better
So is the world we're living in
I'm thankful for the time I spent

With my best friend

Thank you for calling me out
Thank you for waking me up
Thank you for breaking it down
Thank you for choosing us
Thank you for all you're about
Thank you for lifting me up
Thank you for keeping me grounded
And being here now

My life is better,
Because you're a part of it
I know without you by my side
That I would be different
Yes I feel my life is better
And so is the world we're livin' in
I'm thankful for the time I spent
With my best friend

You're my best friend"
Jason Mraz,Quiet,"I want to, I want to hold you

Every time I go home there's another cellphone tower
Construction getting louder,
Paving over yesterdays
You and I, we will try to find the side of it that's pretty
While our town becomes a city,
We won't let it be erased
Empires rise, empires fall
Will you be my constant through it all?

I will hold your hand and watch the world spin idly around this life we're in
Oh yeah everything goes quiet
When it's you I'm with
Oh yeah everything goes quiet
When it's you I'm with
You, you, you...

Every once in a while,
You know I get these real bad headaches
Worried about the mistakes
That I've made along the way
You and I, we can't hide from the fact that we need each other
How else will I recover when the fever comes again

Temperatures rise
Temperatures fall
Will you be my constant through it all?

I will hold your hand and watch the world spin idly around this life we're in
Oh yeah everything goes quiet when it's you I'm with
Oh yeah everything goes quiet when it's you I'm with
You, you, you...

There are no words, no words when
I'm with you, you, you
Every time I hear music
They've added more stuff to it
Things are always moving into a futuristic place
Where you and I will try
We'll try to dance into tomorrow
But time will have to borrow
Not a minute left to waste

Heartbeats rise, heartbeats fall
Will you be my constant through it all?

I will hold your hand
And watch the world spin idly around this life we're in
Oh yeah everything goes quiet when it's you I'm with [x4]"
Jason Mraz,Out Of My Hands,"You went walking away, into the sun
How romantic
But I knew we were done
Was it something I said, something I did
It must be over my head,
I didn't quite understand it
Now it's out of my hands, it's out of my hands
I am sorry for the way you feel about yourself, every day
Baby you needed me to make it, so you could keep on running away
Was it something I said, something I did
It must be over my head
I didn't quite understand it
Now it's out of my hands
It's out of my hands

When it feels like life has gotten out of control
When it feels like much too much to hold
When it feels like too much to understand
No, that's out of your hands
Out of your hands
Out of your hands

Was it something I said, something I did
It must be over my head
I didn't quite understand it
Now it's out of my hands
It's out of my hands

When it feels like life has gotten out of control
When it feels like much too much to hold
When it feels like too much to understand
No, that's out of your hands
Out of your hands
Out of your hands"
Jason Mraz,It's So Hard To Say Goodbye To Yesterday,"How do I say good bye to what we had,
The good times that made us laugh outweigh the bad
I thought we'd get to see forever but forever's gone away
It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday

I don't know where this road is going to lead
All I know is where we've been and what we have been through
If we get to see tomorrow, I hope it's worth all the wait
It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday

And I'll take with me the memories to be my sunshine after the rain
It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday
And I'll take with me the memories to be my sunshine after the rain
It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday
It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday"

Jason Mraz,Back To The Earth,"Whenever my head starts to hurt
Before it goes from bad to feeling worst
I turn off my phone
I get down low
I put my hands in the dirt

I try to stop the world from moving so fast
Try and get a grip on where I'm at
To simplify this daisy life
And get my feet in the grass

I'm going back to the Earth
I'm going back to the Earth
I'm going back to work
I'm going back to the Earth
Yes I'm going Back...

The only explanation for our rise
Must be that everybody wants to get it high

Move on up to a[?]
Up on in the sky[?]

The higher we go, the taller we grow old
We lose sight of our land below
You can have your place up in outer space
Cause my home is where my food is grown

I'm going back to the Earth
I'm going back to the Earth
I'm going back to work
I'm going back to the Earth
(X2)

We are animals (we are animals)
We are wild (we are wild)
And we'll start with emotions at the bottom of the ocean
I was feeling from the top of the trees

We are animals (we are animals)
We are wild (we are wild)

And we'll truly be forgiven when we start getting back to living
With the land in harmony

I'm going back to the earth
I'm going back to the earth
Oh yeah,

I listen to the whistle in the wind
It's blending with the songs of the birds
The messages remind me who I am
That I'm a child of the Earth

It's where I find spirituality
It's in everything that surrounds me
You can spell God G-O-D
Or you can spell it N-A-T-U-R-E

I'm going back to the Earth
I'm going back to the Earth
I'm going back to work
I'm going back to the Earth
I'm going Back!

I'm going back to the Earth
I'm going back to the Earth
I'm going back to work
I'm going back to the Earth
I'm going Back!"
Jason Mraz,A World With You,"Let's hit the road and throw out the map
Wherever we go, we won't look back
'Cause we're going places and we're going there fast
And let's move to Paris and get ourselves a loft
Let's live in squalor, and spare no cost
Let's throw caution to the wind and start over again

Think how many doors we'll open
Just as many stars are shining
Who knows where we're going
Yeah who knows what we'll find
I want to see the world the way I see a world with you

Let's hike in the mountains and challenge our will
Let's leap over canyons and get lost in the hills
I want to see the world the way I see a world with you

Think how many doors we'll open
Just as many stars are sure to shine
Who knows where we're going
And who knows what we'll find
I want to see the world the way I see a world with you

All of our plans will be at sea
The sum of all our failures, they cannot hurt us now
Let's hoist up ourselves
And shove off to China and climb up a wall
We'll keep on climbing, looking over it all
Laughing it up, yeah having a ball

Think how many doors we'll open
Just as many stars are going to shine
Who knows where we're going
And who knows what we'll find
I want to see the world the way I see a world with you
I want to see the world the way I see a world with you"
Jason Mraz,Shine,"Once upon a time there was a meeting of minds
The sun and the moon made a deal with the sky
One would take the morning and the other the night
Together they would blanket the world with light
But the moon had a shadow, he felt like a liar
The sun was the only one who carried the fire
The sun saw this, she kept on glowing
Bound to the moon, never saying, ""you owe me""

She said I'll shine on you (shine on you)
I will shine on you (shine on you)
I will shine on you (shine on you)
I will shine on you

I keep a lamp over you, glowing in my heart
To keep from tripping over troublesome thoughts in the dark
We ain't that different, we huddle underneath the same stars
I see who you really are
You're every creature, every man, every woman and child
You're the closest thing I'll ever get to knowing God
Like the sun to the moon, I'll send my love and light
A love like ours, it'll fill the whole sky

I will shine on you (shine on you)
I will shine on you (shine on you)
I will shine on you (shine on you)
I will shine on you
I will shine on you (shine on you)
I will shine on you (shine on you)
I will shine on you (shine on you)
I will shine, shine, shine on you

Think of the people that you love the most
Send them your light and hope it glows
Say I will shine on you, I will shine on you
No matter the distance, the space, or the time
Love travels in the speed of light
I will shine on you, I will shine on you
I will shine on you, I will shine on you

And if you forget we are the chosen ones
Turn your eyes to the attention of the morning sun
Wherever you go, however you move
The light is gonna shine directly to you
Let it shine on you (shine on you)
Let it shine on you (shine on you)
Let it shine on you (shine on you)
Yes I'm gonna shine on you
I will shine on you (shine on you)
I will shine on you (shine on you)
I will shine on you (shine on you)
I will shine, shine, shine on you"
Jason Mraz,Lucky (feat. Colbie Caillat) - Live On Earth Version,"Do you hear me? I'm talking to you
Across the water across the deep blue ocean
Under the open sky oh my, baby I'm trying
Boy I hear you in my dreams
I feel your whisper across the sea
I keep you with me in my heart
You make it easier when life gets hard

Lucky I'm in love with my best friend
Lucky to have been where I have been
Lucky to be coming home again

They don't know how long it takes
Waiting for a love like this
Every time we say goodbye
I wish we had one more kiss
I wait for you I promise you I will

Lucky I'm in love with my best friend
Lucky to have been where I have been
Lucky to be coming home again
Lucky we're in love in every way
Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed
Lucky to be coming home someday

And so I'm sailing through the sea
To an island where we'll meet
You'll hear the music, fill the air
I'll put a flower in your hair
And though the breeze is through the trees
Move so pretty you're all I see
As the world keeps spinning round
You hold me right here right now

Lucky I'm in love with my best friend
Lucky to have been where I have been
Lucky to be coming home again
Lucky we're in love every way
Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed
Lucky to be coming home someday"
Jason Mraz,The Freedom Song,"I picture something is beautiful
It's full of life and it is all blue
I've seen the sunset on the beach, yeah

Jason Mraz,Living In The Moment,"If this life is one act
Why do we lay all these traps
We put them right in our path
When we just wanna be free

I will not waste my days
Making up all kinds of ways
To worry about some things
That will not happen to me

So I just let go of what I know I don't know
And I know I'll only do this by
Living in the moment
Living our life
Easy and breezy
With peace in my mind
With peace in my heart
Peace in my soul
Wherever I'm going, I'm already home
Living in the moment

I'm letting myself off the hook for things I've done
I let my past go past
And now I'm having more fun
I'm letting go of the thoughts
That do not make me strong
And I believe this way can be the same for everyone

And if I fall asleep
I know you'll be the one who'll always remind me
To live in the moment
To live my life
Easy and breezy
With peace in my mind
I got peace in my heart
Got peace in my soul
Wherever I'm going, I'm already home

I can't walk through life facing backwards
I have tried
I tried more than once to just make sure
And I was denied the future I'd been searching for
But I spun around and searched no more
By living in the moment
Living my life
Easy and breezy
With peace in my mind
I got peace in my heart
Got peace in my soul
Wherever I'm going, I'm already home

I'm living in the moment
I'm living my life
Just taking it easy
With peace in my mind
I got peace in my heart
I got peace in my soul
Oh, wherever I'm going, I'm already home
I'm living in the moment
I'm living my life
Oh, easy and breezy
With peace in my mind
I got peace in my heart
I got peace in my soul
Oh, wherever I'm going, I'm already home
I'm living in the moment"
Jason Mraz,The Woman I Love,"Maybe I annoy you with my choices
Well, you annoy me sometimes too with your voice
But that ain't enough for me
To move out and move on
I'm just gonna love you like the woman I love

We don't have to hurry
You can take as long as you want
I'm holdin' steady
My heart's at home
With my hand behind you
I will catch you if you fall
Yeah I'm gonna love you like the woman I love

Sometimes the world can make you feel
You're not welcome anymore
And you beat yourself up
You let yourself get mad
And in those times when you stop lovin'
That woman I adore
You can relax
Because, babe, I got your back
Uh, I got you
Uh, Yeah

I don't wish to change you
You've got it under control
You wake up each day different
Another reason for me to keep holdin' on
I'm not attached to any way you're showing up
I'm just gonna love you like the woman I love
Yeah I'm gonna love you
Oh, Yeah I'm gonna love you
'Cause you're the woman I love"

Jason Mraz,5/6,"Are you dancing with your partner, or are you pushing them around?
Are you begging for attention, or do you love the one you've found?
Are you giving up your Saturdays to waltz all over town?
Or is everything a jolly holiday with a merry y'all with now

You could give it all away, give it all and be unstoppable
All away, everything is really possible, all away
You never really own it anyway, It'll all fall in place if you just let go

Don't dress up your children like dolls from your past
Or They'll run from you madly, they'll never look back
And when they grow older, they'll do just the same
The world's a reflection of how children play

Well You could give it all away, give it all and be unstoppable
All away, gonna make empty meaningful
You never really own it anyway, It'll all fall in place if you just let go

When you're in the mood, baby
Hear just what your heart has to say
When the world is turning topside and turvy then you better hurry back down
To the bottom of your soul and be loved

Your word is your access, your mouth is your door
Let's slide down inside there, and see what's in store
In the middle there's a rhythm picking, it's a freaking hard beat
At the bottom there's a lot of water keeping your soul deep

You could give it all away, give it all and be unstoppable
All away, everything is really possible, all away
You never really own it anyway, It'll all fall in place if you just let go

When you're in the mood, baby
Hear just what your heart has to say
When the world is turning topside and turvy then you better hurry down
To the bottom of your soul
Get down, get it all, and be loved"
Jason Mraz,Everything Is Sound,"When there is love, I can't wait to talk about it
When things get rough, I like to walk with you
Or when it's night, I like to be the light that's missing
And remind you every minute of the future isn't written
Not yet

When there is love, or when the heart feels heavy
We can lighten it up, if you've had enough
Well you can empty your glass and we can fill it back up
You know it's up to us to make it all up
So what you making up? I can make it up back
You could be loved no matter what
And know the only time is right now, it's right where... where you are
You don't need a vacation when there's nothing to escape from

Singing
La la la la
Let's all sing
La la la la
Laying it down
Everything is sound

Let's sing to be happy, to feel things, to communicate, and be heard
Or sing out to protest, and to project, and to harmonize with birds
Whether it's your birthday or your dying day
It's a celebration too
Rejoice to use your voice and give wings to any of choice
Whatever you're choosing right now, it's right where... where you are
You don't need a vacation when there's nothing to escape from

Set your vibration and undulation to the hightest it can go
And trust me, hear me
If it makes you wanna sing
Just sing it

La la la la
Let's all sing
La la la la
Laying it down
Everything is sound
La la la la
Let's all sing
La la la la
Hallelujah

It's a song that I've forgotten often
It doesn't make me wrong
'Cause we all need the darkness, to see the light
In our own eyes, come on, and sing it

La la la la
Let's all sing
La la la la
Laying it down
Everything is sound
La la la la
Let's all sing
La la la la
Hallelujah
We're connected now
La la la la
Let's all sing
Hallelujah
Everything is sound
La la la
Let's all sing
La la la la
Hallelujah
We're connected now"

Jason Mraz,Frank D. Fixer,"Frank D. Fixer was a handyman
He could handle everything; he was my granddad
He grew his own food and fixed his own car
I watched it all happen in our backyard
He'd reinvent the part to fix the broken home
He restored the heart

I wish I was a fixer
I would fix you up inside
I would build you a town if the world fell down
I wish I was that guy

If Frank D. Fixer were alive today
Well he may laugh at me and he may have a lot to say
Well he might ask that I keep working for the family
To keep the bills all paid and be his protégé
What happened to the ground right where we are?
What happened to the family farm?

I wish I was a fixer
I would fix you up inside
I would build you a town if the world fell down
I wish I was that guy

Every evening breaking bread
He showed us who a real man is
No matter what my grandma says
He would never lose his head

I wish I was a fixer
I would fix you up inside
I would build you a town if the world fell down
I wish I was that guy

I wish I was a farmer
I would grow you a Garden of Eden
I would bless the family with the gifts that granddad handed me
How wonderful that would be
Baby I'll make that guy be me"
Jason Mraz,In Your Hands,"Ticket lines, and places to dine
Taking baths and drinkin' wine
People ask, I say I'm doin' fine.

Motorcycles and for sure The Eiffel Tower
They were made for two
A double bed has never felt so empty
What's missing in the world is you
So I'll leave it in your hands now

To come through
I'll leave it in your hands now
To come through

I like climbing the mountain
I'm climbing back in the bed
I love making breakfast for someone instead of me

Taking autumn walks in Central Park
They were made for two
Afternoon naps have never felt so crappy
What's missing in my life is you
So I'll leave it in your hands now

To come through
I'll leave it in your hands now
To come through
I'll leave it in your hands now
To come through
I'm gonna it in your hands now
To come through

It's like diving into a pool without water
And praying for rain
Well, my life is a good life anyway
What I have will do
But when you're alone
You're living in a world with only choices
And what I choose is you
So I'll leave it in your hands now

To come through
I'll leave it in your hands now
To come through
I'll leave it in your hands now
To come through
I'm gonna it in your hands now
To come through"

Jason Mraz,The World As I See It,"The world as I see it, is a remarkable place
A beautiful house in a forest, of stars in outer space.
From a bird's eye view, I can see it has a well-rounded personality
From a bird's eye view, I can see we are family

It's not hard for me to love you
Hard for me to love you
No it's not a difficult thing
It's not hard for me to love you
Hard for me to love you
Because you are the world to me

Yeah the world as I see it, is a remarkable place
Every man makes a difference
And every mother's child is a saint
From a bird's eye view I can see, we are spiraling down in gravity
From a bird's eye view I can see, you are just like me

It's not hard for me to love you
Hard for me to love you
No it's not a difficult thing.
It's not hard for me to love you
Oh, I really love you
Unconditionally.

No it's not hard for me to love you
Hard for me to love you
No it's not a difficult thing

Oh, I really love you
Love, you are the world to me

You are the mountain, you are the rock
You are the cord and you're the spark
You are the eagle, you are the lark
You are the world and you're remarkable

You're the ocean eating the shore
You are the calm inside the storm
You're every emotion, you can endure
You are the world, and the world is yours.

Hard for me to love you
No it's not a difficult thing
It's not hard for me to love you
Hard for me to love you

Jason Mraz,Hidden Track,"I oh
I'm dreaming of your face
I can see your beauty
Ten and a half thousand yesterdays.
The waning moon illuminates
All the secrets I've been keeping
And cast them off of my balcony.

Oh I I I I I
I hope you notice,
That I, I'm still in love with you
Yes I,
I'm coming over, tonight.
I'm coming over, tonight.
I hope you notice I was never over you.

We hold on to things we said
It makes it more confusing,
I won't let the past get in my way.
Surrender to the eternality now,
Enjoy the midnight serenade

Oh I I I I I
I hope you notice,
That I, I'm coming over, tonight
I'm coming over, tonight
I'm coming over, just to say ""good night""
I hope you notice I was never over you
I hope you notice I was never over you.

My mind is crawling,
But I still hear the music all around me,
You found me.

I I I I
God I love this,
If ever there was a place that I could stay,
I found it

I I I I I
I hope you notice
My love,
I'm coming over, tonight
I'm coming over, tonight
I'm coming over, just to say ""good night"".

Jesse McCartney,Because You Live,"Staring out at the rain with a heavy heart
It's the end of the world in my mind
Then your voice pulls me back like a wake-up call
I've been looking for the answer somewhere
I couldn't see that it was right there
But now I know what I didn't know

Because you live and breathe
Because you make me believe in myself
When nobody else can help
Because you live, girl, my world
Has twice as many stars in the sky

It's all right, I survived, I'm alive again
'Cause of you, made it through every storm
What is life, what's the use if you're killing time
I'm so glad I've found an angel
Someone who was there when all my hopes fell
I wanna fly looking in your eyes

Because you live and breathe
Because you make me believe in myself
When nobody else can help
Because you live, girl, my world
Has twice as many stars in the sky

Because you live, I live

Because you live, there's a reason why
I carry on when I lose the fight
I want to give what you've given me
Always

Because you live and breathe
Because you make me believe in myself
When nobody else can help
Because you live, girl, my world
Has twice as many stars in the sky

Because you live and breathe
Because you make me believe in myself
When nobody else can help
Because you live, girl, my world
Has everything I need to survive

Because you live
I live
I live"
Miley Cyrus,When I Look At You,"Everybody needs inspiration,
Everybody needs a soul
A beautiful melody
When the nights are long

'Cause there is no guarantee
That this life is easy

Yeah, when my world is falling apart
When there's no light to break up the dark
That's when I, I
I look at you

When the waves
Are flooding the shore and I can't
Find my way home anymore
That's when I, I
I look at you

When I look at you I see forgiveness
I see the truth
You love me for who I am
Like the stars hold the moon
Right there where they belong
And I know I'm not alone

Yeah, when my world is falling apart
When there's no light to break up the dark
That's when I, I
I look at you

When the waves
Are flooding the shore and I can't
Find my way home anymore
That's when I, I
I look at you

You appear just like a dream to me
Just like kaleidoscope colors that
Cover me, all I need every
Breath that I breathe don't you know
You're beautiful

Yeah, yeah, yeah

When the waves
Are flooding the shore and I can't
Find my way home anymore

Miley Cyrus,The Climb,"I can almost see it
That dream I'm dreaming, but
There's a voice inside my head saying,
""You'll never reach it""
Every step I'm taking
Every move I make feels lost with no direction
My faith is shakin'
But I, I gotta keep trying
Gotta keep my head held high

There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
Ain't about how fast I get there
Ain't about what's waiting on the other side
It's the climb

The struggles I'm facing
The chances I'm taking
Sometimes might knock me down, but
No, I'm not breaking
I may not know it, 
But these are the moments that,
I'm gonna remember most, yeah
Just gotta keep going
And I, I gotta be strong
Just keep pushing on, 'cause

Train,Drops of Jupiter,"Now that she's back in the atmosphere
With drops of Jupiter in her hair, hey
She acts like summer and walks like rain
Reminds me that there's time to change, hey
Since the return of her stay on the moon
She listens like spring, and she talks like June, hey, hey

Tell me, did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
And that Heaven is overrated?
Tell me, did you fall from shooting star
One without a permanent scar?
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there?

Now that she's back from that soul vacation
Tracing her way through the constellation, hey, mm
She checks out Mozart while she does Tae-Bo
Reminds me that there's a room to grow, hey, yeah

Now that she's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that she might think of me as plain ol' Jane
Told a story about a man who was too afraid to fly so he never did land

But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way?
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind?
Was it everything you wanted to find?
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there?

Can you imagine your love, pride, deep-fried chicken?
Your best friend always sticking up for you
Even when I know you're wrong
Can you imagine your first dance, freeze dried romance?
Five-hour phone conversation, the best soy latte that you ever had
And me

But tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet?(feet?)
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day (light of day)
And head back toward the Milky Way?
Tell me did you sail across the sun?

Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights are faded
And that Heaven is overrated?
Tell me, did you fall from shooting star
One without a permanent scar?
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself?

And did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day?

And did you fall from a shooting star, fall from a shooting star?
And are you lonely looking for yourself out there?"
Dua Lipa,New Rules,"(One, one, one)

Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)

My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself

One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again

Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the mornin'
And if you're under him
You ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

I keep pushin' forwards but he keeps pullin' me backwards
(Nowhere to turn, no way, nowhere to turn, no)
Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern
(I never learn, I never learn)

But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself

Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,"He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, ""That's a lie""
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On backroads at night

And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone

But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back

It's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read is:

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
Oh, think of me, mmm

He said the way my blue eyes shine
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, ""That's a lie"""
Taylor Swift,Picture To Burn,"State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine, I'll tell mine you're gay
By the way...

I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're just another picture to burn

There's no time for tears
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be

I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're just another picture to burn

And if you're missing me, you'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause coming back around here would be bad for your health...

'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard, I really really hate that...

Stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying

That I want and I'm needing, everything that we should be
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny
That I can't even see anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes so perfectly, the kind of flawless I wish I could be
She better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

So I drive home alone
As I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down
And maybe get some sleep tonight

'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into

What a rainy ending
Given to a perfect day
Just walk away
Ain't no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

You put up walls
And paint them all a shade of grey
And I stood there loving you
And wished them all away
And you come away with a great little story
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you

Oh, what a shame
What a rainy ending
Given to a perfect day
So, just walk away
Ain't no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

You never did give a damn thing, honey
But I cried, cried for you
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody
If I died, died for you, died for you

Counting all the scars you made

Don't you know you're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh, but, if it don't

If what you are is a daydream,
I'll never get to hold
At least you'll know

And our mamas smiled
And rolled their eyes
And said ""Oh, my, my, my""

Took me back to the house and the backyard trees
Said you'd beat me up you were bigger than me
You never did
You never did
Took me back when the world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
Just two kids
You and I

I wasn't that little girl you used to see
But your eyes still shined
Like pretty lights
And our daddy's used to joke about the two of us
They never believed we'd really fall in love
And our mamas smiled
And rolled their eyes,
And said ""Oh, my, my, my""

Took me back to the creek beds we turned up
Two A.M. running in your truck
And all I need is you next to me
Took me back to the time we had our very first fight
Slamming up doors instead of kissing goodnight
You stayed outside
Till the morning light
Oh, my, my, my

A few years have gone and come around
We were sitting at our favorite spot in town,
And you looked at me
Got down on one knee

Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
Our whole town came
And our mamas cried
You said ""I do""
And I did too
Take me home where we met so many years before
We'll rock our babies on the very front porch

Taylor Swift,I'm Only Me When I'm With You,"Friday night beneath the stars
In a field behind your yard
You and I are painting pictures in the sky
And sometimes we don't say a thing
Just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need is right here by my side
And I know everything about you
I don't wanna live without you

I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only trying
To let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

Just a small town boy and girl
Livin' in a crazy world
Tryin' to figure out what is and isn't true
And I don't try to hide my tears
The secrets all my deepest fears
Through it all nobody gets me like you do
And you know everything about me
You say that you can't live without me

I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only trying
To let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

When I'm with anybody else
It's so hard to be myself
Only you can see

I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only trying
To let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me, who I wanna be
Well, I'm only me when I'm with you
With you"
Taylor Swift,Invisible,"She can't see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile
She'll never notice how you stop and stare
Whenever she walks by
And you can't see me wantin' you the way you want her
But you are everything to me

And I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
She's never gonna love you
Like I want to
You just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable
Instead of just invisible

There's a fire inside of you
That can't help but shine through
She's never gonna see the light
No matter what you do
And all I think about is how to make you think of me
And everything that we could be

I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
She's never gonna love you
Like I want to
And you just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable,
Instead of just invisible

Like shadows in a faded light
Oh, we're invisible
I just wanna look in your eyes
And make you realise

I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
Baby, let me love you
Let me want you
You just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable
Instead of just invisible

She can't see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile"
Taylor Swift,A Perfectly Good Heart,"Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?

Maybe I should've seen the signs
Should've read the writing on the wall
And realised by the distance in your eyes
That I would be the one to fall

No matter what you say
I still can't believe
That you would walk away
It don't make sense to me, but:

Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?

It's not unbroken anymore
How do I get it back the way it was before?

Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break, would you wanna break a:

Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?"
Taylor Swift,Our Song,"I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, ""Baby, is somethin' wrong?""
I say, ""Nothing, I was just thinkin'
How we don't have a song""
And he says:

Our song is the slammin' screen doors
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have""
And when I got home
For I said, ""Hey, man!""
Askin' God if he
Could play it again

I was walking up the front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong had been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way
To my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said:

Our song is the slammin' screen doors
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have""
And when I got home
For I said, ""Hey, man!""
Askin' God if he
Could play it again

I've heard every hour and listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song

'Cause our song is the slammin' screen doors
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date ""Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have""
And when I got home
For I said, ""Hey, man!""
Askin' God if he
Could play it again
Play it again

I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I wrote down our song"
Taylor Swift,You Belong With Me,"You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor
Like I do

I'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listenin' to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story
Like I do

But she wears short skirts, I wear t-shirts
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreamin' 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see
You belong with me?
You belong with me

Walkin' the streets with you and your worn out jeans
I can't help thinkin' this is how it ought to be
Laughin' on a park bench, thinkin' to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?

And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, what ya doin' with a girl like that?

She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreamin' 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're lookin' for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you
See
You belong with me?

Standin' by you, waitin' at your back door
All this time, how could you not know
Baby, you belong with me
You belong with me

Oh I remember you, drivin' to my house in the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh, when you know you're 'bout to cry
I know your favorite songs, and you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong, think I know it's with me

Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you?
Been here all along, so why can't you
See
You belong with me?

Standin' by you, waitin' at your back door
All this time, how could you not know
Baby
You belong with me, you belong with me

You belong with me, have you ever thought, just maybe
You belong with me, you belong with me"
Train,Drive By,"We should be sorry you're the one who left. Listen, I'm gonna be late for work. Bye.
On the other side of a street I knew
Stood a girl that looked like you
I guess that's déjà vu
But I thought this can't be true
'Cause you moved to west L.A. or New York or Santa Fe
Or wherever to get away from me

Oh but that one night
Was more than just right
I didn't leave you 'cause I was all through
Oh I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
Because I really fell for you

Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy looking for a 2-ply

Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me everything is groovy
They don't like it sue me
The way you do me

Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by

On the other side of a downward spiral
My love for you went viral
And I loved you every mile you drove away
But now here you are again
So let's skip the ""How you been?""
And get down to the ""more than friends"" at last

Oh but that one night was still the highlight
I didn't need you until I came to
And I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
Because I really fell for you

Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy looking for a 2-ply

Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me everything is groovy
They don't like it sue me
The way you do me

Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by

Please believe that when I leave
There's nothing up my sleeve but love for you
And a little time to get my head together too

On the other side of a street I knew
Stood a girl that looked like you
I guess that's déjà vu
But I thought this can't be true
'Cause...

Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy looking for a 2-ply

Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me everything is groovy
They don't like it sue me
The way you do me

Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya

Train,Marry Me,"Forever could never be long enough for me
To feel like I've had long enough with you
Forget the world now
We won't let them see
But there's one thing left to do
Now that the weight has lifted
And love has surely shifted my way

Marry me
Today and every day
Marry me
If I ever get the nerve to say hello in this café
Say you will... mmm mmm
Say you will... mmm mmm

Together could never be close enough for me
To feel like I am close enough to you
You wear white and I'll wear out the words
I love you and you're beautiful
Now that the wait is over
And love has finally showed her my way

Marry me
Today and every day
Marry me
If I ever get the nerve to say hello in this café
Say you will... mmm mmm
Say you will... mmm mmm

Promise me
You'll always be
Happy by my side
I promise to
Sing to you
When all the music dies

Marry me
Today and every day
Marry me
If I ever get the nerve to say hello in this café
Say you will... mmm mmm
Say you will... mmm mmm
Marry me"
Alan Jackson,Remember When,"Remember when I was young and so were you
And time stood still, and love was all we knew
You were the first, so was I
We made love and then you cried, remember when

Remember when we vowed the vows and walked the walk
Gave our hearts, made the start and it was hard
We lived and learned, life threw curves
There was joy, there was hurt, remember when

Remember when old ones died and new were born
And life was changed, disassembled, rearranged
We came together, fell apart
And broke each others hearts, remember when

Remember when, the sound of little feet
Was the music we danced to week to week
Brought back the love, we found trust
Vowed we'd never give it up, remember when

Remember when thirty seemed so old
Now, lookin' back, it's just a steppin' stone
To where we are, where we've been
Said we'd do it all again, remember when

Remember when we said, when we turn gray
When the children grow up and move away
We won't be sad, we'll be glad
For all the life we've had 
And we'll remember when

Remember when
Remember when"
Westlife,I Wanna Grow Old with You,"Shane:
Another day without your smile
Another day just passes by
But now I know how much it means
For you to stay right here with me
The time we spent apart will make our love grow stronger
But it hurts so bad I can't take it any longer

I wanna grow old with you
I wanna die lying in your arms
I wanna grow old with you
I wanna be looking in your eyes
I wanna be there for you, sharing everything you do
I wanna grow old with you

Brian:
A thousand miles between us now
It causes me to wonder how
Our love tonight remains so strong
It makes our risk right all along

Kian:
The time we spent apart will make our love grow stronger
Nicky:
But it hurt so bad I can't take it any longer

All:
I wanna grow old with you
I wanna die lying in your arms
I wanna grow old with you
I wanna be looking in your eyes
I wanna be there for you, sharing everything you do
I wanna grow old with you

Mark:
Things can come and go
I know but baby I believe
Something's burning strong between us
That makes it clear to me

All:
I wanna grow old with you
I wanna die lying in your arms
I wanna grow old with you
I wanna be looking in your eyes
I wanna be there for you, sharing everything you do

Eminem,Space Bound,"We touch, I feel a rush, we clutch it isn't much
But it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
It's lust, it's torturous, you must be a sorceress
'Cause you just did the impossible, gained my trust

Don't play games it'll be dangerous, if you fuck me over
'Cause if I get burnt, I'ma show ya what it's like to hurt
'Cause I've been treated like dirt before ya
And love is evil, spell it backwards I'll show ya

Nobody knows me I'm cold, walk down this road all alone
It's no one's fault but my own, it's the path I've chosen to go
Frozen as snow, I show no emotion whatsoever, so
Don't ask me why I have no love for these mo'fuckin' hoes

Blood sucking succubuses, what the fuck is up with this
I've tried in this department, but I ain't had no luck with this
It sucks, but it's exactly what I thought it would be
Like trying to start over

I got a hole in my heart, like some kind of emotional roller coaster
Something I won't go on, so you toy with my emotions ho it's over
It's like an explosion every time I hold ya, wasn't joking when I told ya
You take my breath away, you're a supernova and I'm a

I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aiming right at you, right at you, right at you

I'll do whatever it takes, when I'm with you I get the shakes
My body aches when I ain't, with you I have zero strength
There's no limit on how far I would go, no boundaries, no lengths
Why do we say that until we get that person that we think's

Gonna be that one and then once we get 'em, it's never the same
You want 'em when they don't want you, soon as they do feelings change
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
I wasn't looking when I stumbled on to you, must have been fate

But so much is at stake, what the fuck does it take
Let's cut to the chase, 'fore the door shuts in your face
Promise me, if I cave in and break and leave myself open
That I won't be making a mistake, 'cause I'm a

I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aiming right at you, right at you, right at you

So after a year and six months, it's no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts, never mistreated you once
I poured my heart out to you, let down my guard, swear to God
I'll blow my brains in your lap, lay here and die in your arms

Drop to my knees and I'm pleading, I'm trying to stop you from leaving
You won't even listen so fuck it, I'm trying to stop you from breathing
I put both hands on your throat, I sit on top of you squeezing
Till I snap your neck like a Popsicle stick

Ain't no possible reason I could think of
To let you walk up out this house and let you live
Tears streamed down both of my cheeks, then I let you go and just give
And 'fore I put that gun to my temple, I told you this

And I would've did anything for you
To show you how much I adored you
But it's over now, it's too late to save our love
Just promise me you'll think of me
Every time you look up in the sky and see a star, 'cause I'm a

I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm so lost without you, without you, without you"
Avril Lavigne,Sk8er Boi,"He was a boy, she was a girl
Can I make it any more obvious?
He was a punk, she did ballet
What more can I say?
He wanted her, she'd never tell
Secretly she wanted him as well
But all of her friends stuck up their nose
They had a problem with his baggy clothes

He was a skater boy
She said, ""See ya later, boy""
He wasn't good enough for her
She had a pretty face
But her head was up in space
She needed to come back down to Earth

Five years from now, she sits at home
Feeding the baby, she's all alone
She turns on TV, guess who she sees?
Skater boy rocking on MTV
She calls up her friends, they already know
And they've all got tickets to see his show
She tags along, stands in the crowd
Looks up at the man that she turned down

He was a skater boy
She said, ""See ya later, boy""
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a superstar
Slammin' on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?

He was a skater boy

Now he's a superstar
Slammin' on his guitar

Sorry, girl, but you missed out
Well tough luck, that boy's mine now
We are more than just good friends
This is how the story ends
Too bad that you couldn't see
See the man that boy could be
There is more than meets the eye
I see the soul that is inside

He's just a boy and I'm just a girl
Can I make it any more obvious?
We are in love, haven't you heard
How we rock each other's world?

I'm with the skater boy
I said, ""See ya later, boy
I'll be backstage after the show
I'll be at a studio
Singing the song we wrote
About a girl you used to know""

To be with you again
Gonna tell you that I love you,
In the best way that I can.
I can't take a day without you here,
You're the light that makes my darkness disappear.

I can reach my tomorrow,
I can hold my head up high,
And it's all because you're by my side.

When you look me in the eyes,
And tell me that you love me.
Everything's all right,

John Mayer,The Heart of Life,"I hate to see you cry
Lying there in that position
There's things you need to hear
So turn off your tears
And listen

Pain throws your heart to the ground
Love turns the whole thing around
No it won't all go the way it should
But I know the heart of life is good

You know, it's nothing new
Bad news never had good timing
But then, the circle of your friends
Will defend the silver lining

Pain throws your heart to the ground
Love turns the whole thing around
No it won't all go the way it should
But I know the heart of life is good

Pain throws your heart to the ground
Love turns the whole thing around
Fear is a friend who's misunderstood
But I know the heart of life is good
I know it's good"
Sidewalk Prophets,This Is Not Goodbye,"I can see it in your eyes that you are restless
The time has come for you to leave
It's so hard to let you go but in this life I know
You have to be who you were made to be

As you step out on the road I'll say a prayer
So that in my heart you always will be there

This is not goodbye
I know we'll meet again
So let your life begin
'Cause this is not goodbye
It's just ""I love you"" to take with you
Until you're home again

The stirring in your soul has left you wondering
Should you stay or turn around
Well, just remember that your dreams they are a promise
That you were made to change the world
So don't let fear stop you now 'cause

This is not goodbye
I know we'll meet again
So let your life begin
'Cause this is not goodbye
It's just ""I love you"" to take with you
Until you're home again

I know the brightest star above
Was created by the One who loved
More than we'll ever know
To guide you when you're lost

What started as a still, small voice
Is raging now and your only choice
Is to follow who you are
So follow who you are 'cause

This is not goodbye
I know we'll meet again
Oh

This is not goodbye
I know we'll meet again
So let your life begin
'Cause this is not goodbye
It's just ""I love you"" to take with you
Until you're home again"
John Mayer,You're Gonna Live Forever in Me,"A great big bang and dinosaurs
Fiery raining meteors
It all ends unfortunately

But you're gonna live forever in me
I'll guarantee, just wait and see

Parts of me were made by you
And planets keep their distance too
The moon's got a grip on the sea

And you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, it's your destiny

Life is full of sweet mistakes
And love's an honest one to make
Time leaves no fruit on the tree

But you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, it's just meant to be

And when the pastor rises the pews
From reasons he can't marry you
I'll keep my word and my seat

But you're gonna live forever in me
I'll guarantee, just wait and see"
John Mayer,Never on the Day You Leave,"No it's never on the day you leave
That you wonder what you still believe in
And you can't remember why you said goodbye
You'll hear an old familiar sound and hope it's her when you turn around
But never, never on the day you leave

Love grows in the time it's been
Since you last heard her sing
She'll cut her hair and move somewhere
She don't owe you anything

No it's never on the day you leave
You can tell how it's gonna be
To watch a girl become a ghost before your eyes
You wish you'd given her one more kiss
To put away for a night like this
But never, never on the day you leave

Love grows in the time it's been
Since you last held her hand
She'll fight for you like hell
Then force herself to like some other man

No it's never on the day you leave
That you remember Christmas Eve
And all the things you miss about her crazy family
You'll know how lonely it is to see a little drug store Christmas tree
But never, never on the day you leave
No never, never on the day you leave

So maybe it'd be better off to write her
And leave a little note right there beside her
That says maybe we're not perfect
But I'll be damned if I ever leave
Damned if I ever leave
Damned if I ever leave"
Lorde,Royals,"I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address
In the torn-up town, no postcode envy

But every song's like
Gold teeth, Grey Goose, tripping in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashing the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams

But everybody's like
Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair

And we'll never be royals (Royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz

Let me be your ruler (Ruler)
You can call me Queen Bee
And baby, I'll rule (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy

My friends and I, we've cracked the code
We count our dollars on the train to the party
And everyone who knows us knows
That we're fine with this, we didn't come from money

But every song's like
Gold teeth, Grey Goose, tripping in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashing the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams

But everybody's like
Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair

And we'll never be royals (Royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz

Let me be your ruler (Ruler)
You can call me Queen Bee
And baby, I'll rule (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy

Oh, oh, oh
We're bigger than we ever dreamed
And I'm in love with being queen

Oh, oh, oh
Life is great without a care
We aren't caught up in your love affair

And we'll never be royals (Royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz

Let me be your ruler (Ruler)
You can call me Queen Bee
And baby, I'll rule (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy"
Bad Meets Evil,Lighters,"Bruno Mars:
This one's for you and me, livin' out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
Lift my arms out wide, I open my eyes, and now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters, a sky full of lighters

Eminem:
By the time you hear this I will have already spiraled up
I would never do nothing to let you cowards fuck my world up
If I was you, I would duck, or get struck like lightning
Fighters keep fighting, put your lighters up, point em' skyward, uh

Had a dream I was king, I woke up, still king
This rap game's nipple is mine for the milking
Till nobody else even fucking feels me, till it kills me
I swear to God I'll be the fucking illest in this music

There is or there ever will be, disagree
Feel free, but from now on I'm refusing to ever give up
The only thing I ever gave up's using, no more excuses
Excuse me if my head is too big for this building

And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick, but you cocks are slick
Poppin' shit on how you flipped ya life around, crock-o-shit
Who you dicks try to kid, flipped dick, you did the opposite
You stayed the same, 'cause cock backwards is still cock, you pricks

I love it when I tell 'em shove it 'cause it wasn't that
Long ago when Marshall sat, luster lacked, flustered
'Cause he couldn't cut mustard, muster up nothing
Brain fuzzy, 'cause he's buzzin', woke up from that buzz, and now you wonder

Why he does it, how he does it, wasn't 'cause he had buzzards circle around his head
Waiting for him to drop dead, was it
Or was it 'cause them bitches wrote him off
Little hussy ass, 'cause fuck, guess it doesn't matter now, does it

What difference it make, what's it take, to get it through your thick skulls
If this ain't, some bullshit people don't usually come back this way
From a place that was dark as I was in just to get to this place
Now let these words be like a switch blade to a hater's rib cage

And let it be known from this day forward
I wanna just say thanks 'cause your hate is what gave me the strength
So let 'em Bics raise 'cause I came with 5'9"" but I feel like I'm 6'8""

Bruno Mars:
This one's for you and me, livin' out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
Lift my arms out wide, I open my eyes, and now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters, a sky full of lighters

Royce da 5'9"":
By the time you hear this I'll probably already be outtie
I advance like going from toting iron to going and
Buying 4 or 5 of the homies the iron man Audi
My daddy told me ""Slow down, boy, you going to blow it""

And I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute
To tell Shady I love him the same way that he did Dr. Dre on The Chronic
Tell him how real he is or how high I am
Or how I would kill for him to know it

I cried plenty tears, my daddy got a bad back
So it's only right that I right
Till he can march right into that post office and tell 'em to hang it up
Now his career's Lebron's jersey in 20 years

I'll stop when I'm at the very top
You shitted on me on your way up, it's 'bout to be a scary drop
'Cause what goes up must come down
You going down on something you don't wanna see, like a hairy box

Every hour, happy hour now, life is wacky now
Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy
Now I'm just the cats meow, ow
Classic cow, always down for the catch weight like Pacquiao

Y'all are doomed, I remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me
My car starts itself, parks itself, and autotunes
'Cause now I'm in the Aston, I went from having my city locked up
To getting treated like Kwame Kilpatrick

And now I'm fantastic, compared to a weed high
And y'all niggas just gossipin' like bitches on a radio and TV
See me, we fly
Y'all buggin' out like Wendy Williams staring at a beehive

And how real is that
I remember signing my first deal
And now I'm the second best, I can deal with that
Now Bruno can show his ass, without the MTV Awards gag

Bruno Mars:
You and I know what it's like
To be kicked down, forced to fight
But tonight we're all right
So hold up your lights
Let it shine

'Cause this one's for you and me, livin' out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
Lift my arms out wide, I open my eyes, and now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters, a sky full of lighters"
Lord Huron,The Night We Met,"I am not the only traveler
Who has not repaid his debt
I've been searching for a trail to follow again
Take me back to the night we met
And then I can tell myself
What the hell I'm supposed to do
And then I can tell myself
Not to ride along with you

I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met

I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Take me back to the night we met
When the night was full of terrors
And your eyes were filled with tears
When you had not touched me yet
Take me back to the night we met

I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Take me back to the night we met"
Shawn Mendes,Roses,"It's not that I'm afraid I'm not enough for her
It's not that I can't find the words to say
But when she's with him, she seems happier
And I don't wanna take that away

How many times can I see your face?
How many times will you walk away?
I just have to let you know

I'm not trying to start a fire with this flame
But I'm worried that your heart might feel the same
And I have to be honest with you baby
Tell me if I'm wrong and this is crazy
But I got you this rose and I gotta know
Will you let it die or let it grow?
Die or let it go, oh

It's not that I don't care about the love you have
It's not that I don't want to see you smile
But there's no way that he can feel the same
'Cause when I think of you my mind goes wild

How many times can I see your face?
How many times will you walk away?
I just have to let you know

I'm not trying to start a fire with this flame
But I'm worried that your heart might feel the same
And I have to be honest with you baby
Tell me if I'm wrong, and this is crazy
But I got you this rose and I need to know
Will you let it die or let it grow?

You could tell me to stop if you already know
Though I'm not sure my heart can take it 
But the look on your face says ""don't let me go""

I'm not trying to start a fire with this flame
But I'm worried that your heart might feel the same
And I have to be honest with you baby
Tell me if I'm wrong, and this is crazy
But I got you this rose and I need to know
Will you let it die or let it go?

I'm not trying to start a fire with this flame

Will you let it die or let it grow?"
Fleurie,Breathe,"I hear the sound, echoes beneath
Angels and skylines meet
And I'm straining to reach
The light on the surface
Light on the other side

I feel the pages turning
I see the candle burning down
Before my eyes, before my wild eyes
I feel you holding me
Tighter, I cannot see
When will we finally
Breathe

And I feel the pages turning

Jaymes Young,I'll Be Good,"I thought I saw the devil, this morning
Looking in the mirror, drop of rum on my tongue
With the warning to help me see myself clearer
I never meant to start a fire
I never meant to make you bleed
I'll be a better man today

I'll be good, I'll be good
And I'll love the world, like I should
Yeah, I'll be good, I'll be good
For all of the times that I never could

My past has tasted bitter for years now
So I wield an iron fist, grace is just a weakness
Or so I've been told
I've been cold, I've been merciless
But the blood on my hands scares me to death
Maybe I'm waking up today

I'll be good, I'll be good
And I'll love the world, like I should
I'll be good, I'll be good
I'll be good, I'll be good

For all of the light that I shut out
For all of the innocent things that I doubt
For all of the bruises I've caused and the tears
For all of the things that I've done all these years, no
Yeah, for all of the sparks that I stomped out
For all of the perfect things that I doubt

I'll be good, I'll be good
And I'll love the world, like I should
Yeah, I'll be good, I'll be good
For all of the times I never could
For all of the times I never could
For all of the times I never could"
Taylor Swift,You're Not Sorry,"All this time I was wasting
Hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time
And all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long
Baby, but I've figured you out
And you thinking we'll be fine again
But not this time around

You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't want to hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry, no, no, no, no

Looking so innocent
I might believe you if I didn't know
Could have loved you all my life
If you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
And you've got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know
And now you're asking me to listen
'Cause it's worked each time before

But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't want to hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry, no, no
You're not sorry, no, no

You had me crawling for you, honey
And it never would have gone away, no
You used to shine so bright
But I watched all of it fade

So you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry, no, no
You're not sorry, no, no"
Uncle Kracker,Smile,"You're better than the best
I'm lucky just to linger in your light
Cooler then the flip side of my pillow, that's right

Completely unaware
Nothing can compare to where you send me
Let me know that it's okay, yeah it's okay
And the moments when my good times start to fade

You make me smile like the sun
Fall out of bed, sing like a bird
Dizzy in my head, spin like a record
Crazy on a Sunday night

You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold, buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild
Oh, you make me smile

Even when you're gone
Somehow you come along
Just like a flower poking through the sidewalk crack 
And just like that
You steal away the rain and just like that

You make me smile like the sun
Fall out of bed, sing like a bird
Dizzy in my head, spin like a record
Crazy on a Sunday night

You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold, buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild
Ohh, you make me smile

Don't know how I lived without you
'Cause every time that I get around you
I see the best of me inside your eyes
You make me smile

You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold, buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild

You make me smile like the sun
Fall out of bed, sing like a bird
Dizzy in my head, spin like a record
Crazy on a Sunday night

You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold, buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild
Oh, you make me smile

Oh, you make me smile

Oh, you make me smile"
Ed Sheeran,She,"I paid all my dues
And she wanted to know
That I'd never leave her
Now I'm ready to go
As strange as it seems
She's endless to me
She's just like paperwork but harder to read

Patience's my enemy
Loving's my friend
It's harder to leave with my heart on my sleeve
Than to stay and just pretend

Oh she, knows me so well
Oh she, knows me like I know myself

I made all my plans
And as she has made hers
She kept me in mind
But I wasn't sure
I searched every room
For a way to escape
But every time I try to leave she keeps holding on to me for delight
And blocking my way

Patience's my enemy

Loving's my friend
It's harder to leave with my heart on my sleeve
Than to stay and just pretend

Oh she, knows me so well
Oh she, knows me like I know myself

And like the back of her hand she already understands everything
""Won't you stay"" she says
And she already knows how it goes 
And where she stands I'll stay, anyway

'Cause she knows me so well
Oh she, knows me like I know myself 
Oh she, knows me so well 
Oh she, knows me like I know myself
I know myself

Oh she, knows me like I know myself
I know myself
I know myself
I know myself"

Taylor Swift,Wildest Dreams,"He said, ""Let's get out of this town""
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds""
I thought heaven can't help me now
Nothing lasts forever

But this is gonna take me down
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is...

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams...
Wildest dreams...

I said, ""No one has to know what we do""
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothing lasts forever

But this is getting good now
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request is...

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams...

Backstreet Boys,Something That I Already Know,"Here we are
Seven days
And seven nights of empty tries
This ritual's, habitual,
But it's never gonna work this time

We're to the point of no return
And along the way the only thing we've learned
Is how to hurt each other

I'm looking back
And wondering why
It took so long to realize
That nothing's changed
It never will
All these years of standing still
Still we'll stay in all this pain
And nothing's gonna make it go away

I don't wanna wait another minute
Put me out of my misery
I can read your mind
Baby you're not in it
We're not what we used to be,
No you wouldn't have to lie to me
If you would only let me go
And I don't wanna wait another minute
To hear

Something that I already know
I know I know I know
Something that I already know
I know I know I know

So save your voice
Don't waste your breath
Can't you see we're at the end
And this goodbye, feels permanent,
So wish me well, try to forget

All the fights
And all the ways
We almost made it
But we never did
And it's finally come to this

I don't wanna wait another minute
Put me out of my misery
I can read your mind
Baby you're not in it
We're not what we used to be,
No you wouldn't have to lie to me
If you would only let me go
And I don't wanna wait another minute
To hear
Something that I already know

We can not hide
What we've become
So sick and tired of being done,
It's done
It's done
It's done

I don't wanna wait another minute
Put me out of my misery
I can read your mind
Baby you're not in it
We're not what we used to be,
No you wouldn't have to lie to me
If you would only let me go
And I don't wanna wait another minute
To hear

Something that I already know
I know I know I know
Something that I already know
'Cause I know I know I know
Something that I already know
'Cause I know I know I know
I know 'cause I know"

I've made a few
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
But I've come through
(And I mean to go on and on and on and on)

We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting 'till the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions
Of the world

I've taken my bows
And my curtain calls
You brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it
I thank you all

But it's been no bed of roses
No pleasure cruise
I consider it a challenge before the whole human race
And I ain't gonna lose, ah
(And I mean to go on and on and on and on)

We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting 'till the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions
Of the world

We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting 'till the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions"
Lionel Richie,Hello,"I've been alone with you inside my mind
And in my dreams, I've kissed your lips a thousand times
I sometimes see you pass outside my door
Hello, is it me you're looking for?

I can see it in your eyes
I can see it in your smile
You're all I've ever wanted
And my arms are open wide

'Cause you know just what to say
And you know just what to do
And I want to tell you so much
I love you

I long to see the sunlight in your hair
And tell you time and time again how much I care
Sometimes I feel my heart will overflow
Hello, I've just got to let you know

'Cause I wonder where you are
And I wonder what you do
Are you somewhere feeling lonely
Or is someone loving you?

Tell me how to win your heart
For I haven't got a clue
But let me start by saying
I love you

Hello, is it me you're looking for?

But I wonder where you are
And I wonder what you do
Are you somewhere feeling lonely
Is someone loving you?

Tell me how to win your heart
For I haven't got a clue
But let me start by saying
I love you"

John Mayer,Love on the Weekend,"It's a Friday, we finally made it
I can't believe I get to see your face
You've been working and I've been waiting
To pick you up and take you from this place

Love on the weekend
Love on the weekend
Like only we can
Like only we can
Love on the weekend
Love on the weekend
I'm coming up and I'm loving every minute of it

You be the DJ, I'll be the driver
You put your feet up in the getaway car
I'm flying fast like a, a wanted man
I want you, baby, like you can't understand

Love on the weekend
Love on the weekend
We found a message in a bottle we were drinking
Love on the weekend
Love on the weekend
I hate your guts 'cause I'm loving every minute of it

I gotta leave ya, it's gonna hurt me
My clothes are dirty and my friends are getting worried
Down there below us, under the clouds
Baby, take my hand and pull me down, down, down, down
And I'll be dreamin' of the next time we can go
Into another seratonin overflow

Love on the weekend
Love on the weekend
I'm busted up but I'm loving every minute of it
(Love on the weekend, love on the weekend)

I'm looking for a little love
I'm looking for a little love, oh yeah

John Mayer,Who Says,"Who says I can't get stoned
Turn off the lights and the telephone
Me in my house alone
Who says I can't get stoned

Who says I can't be free
From all of the things that I used to be
Rewrite my history
Who says I can't be free

It's been a long night in New York City
It's been a long night in Baton Rouge
I don't remember you looking any better
But then again I don't remember you

Who says I can't get stoned
Call up a girl that I used to know
Fake love for an hour or so
Who says I can't get stoned

Who says I can't take time
Meet all the girls in the county line
Wait on fate to send a sign
Who says I can't take time

It's been a long night in New York City
It's been a long night in Austin too
I don't remember you looking any better
But then again I don't remember you

Who says I can't get stoned
Plan a trip to Japan alone
Doesn't matter if I even go
Who says I can't get stoned

It's been a long night in New York City
It's been a long time since twenty-two
I don't remember you looking any better
But then again I don't remember, don't remember you"
John Mayer,Gravity,"Gravity
Is working against me
And gravity
Wants to bring me down

I'll never know what makes this man
With all the love that his heart can stand
Dream of ways to throw it all away

Gravity
Is working against me
And gravity
Wants to bring me down

Twice as much ain't twice as good
And can't sustain like one-half could
It's wanting more that's gonna send me to my knees

Gravity
Stay the hell away from me
Gravity
Has taken better men than me
Now how can that be?
Just keep me where the light is
Keep me where the light is"
John Mayer,Slow Dancing in a Burning Room,"It's not a silly little moment
It's not the storm before the calm
This is the deep and dying breath
Of this love that we've been working on

Can't seem to hold you like I want to
So I can feel you in my arms
Nobody's gonna come and save you
We pulled too many false alarms

We're going down
And you can see it, too
We're going down
And you know that we're doomed
My dear, we're slow dancing in a burning room

I was the one you always dreamed of
You were the one I tried to draw
How dare you say it's nothing to me?
Baby, you're the only light I ever saw
I'll make the most of all the sadness
You'll be a bitch because you can
You'll try to hit me just hurt me
So you leave me feeling dirty
Cause you can't understand

We're going down
And you can see it, too
We're going down
And you know that we're doomed
My dear, we're slow dancing in a burning room

Go cry about it, why don't you?

Don't you think we oughta know by now?
Don't you think we should have learned somehow?"
John Mayer,Your Body Is a Wonderland,"We got the afternoon
You got this room for two
One thing I've left to do
Discover me
Discovering you

One mile to every inch of
Your skin like porcelain
One pair of candy lips and
Your bubblegum tongue

And if you want love
We'll make it
Swimming a deep sea
Of blankets
Take all your big plans
And break 'em
This is bound to be a while

Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder
(I'll use my hands)
Your body is a wonderland

Something 'bout the way
Your hair falls in your face
I love the shape you take when crawling
Towards the pillowcase
You tell me where to go and
Though I might leave to find it
I'll never let your head hit the bed
Without my hand behind it

You want love?
We'll make it
Swimming a deep sea
Of blankets
Take all your big plans
And break 'em
This is bound to be a while
Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder

You can break everything I am

Like a skyscraper, like a skyscraper

As the smoke clears, I awaken
And untangle you from me
Would it make you feel better
To watch me while I bleed?
All my windows still are broken
But I'm standing on my feet

Cody Simpson,On My Mind,"(Cody Simpson - Verse 1)

I'm sleeping through the day
I'm trying not to fade
But every single night
I've just been lying awake
'Cause I, I can't get you off my mind

The moment that we met, I didn't know yet
That I was looking at a face I'll never forget
'Cause I, I can't get you off my mind

I can't get you off my mind
Give me the chance to love you
I'll tell you the only reason why
Cause you are on my mind
I want to know you feel it
What do you see when you close your eyes
Cause you are on my mind

(Cody Simpson - Verse 2)

I want to be best
I want to be worst
I want to be the gravity in your universe
And I, I want to be there to help you fly
I'll help you fly girl

Oh, the longer that I wait
The more that I'm afraid
That someone's gonna fool your heart and take you away

'Cause I, I finally realized,
That I can't get you off my mind

Give me the chance to love
I'll tell you the only reason why
Cause you are on my mind
I want to know you feel it
What do you see when you close your eyes
Cause you are on my mind

Girl I can't live without you
I can't think straight without you, no
So tell me what should I do
If I can't get you off my mind

Give me the chance to love
I'll tell you the only reason why
Cause you are on my mind

I gotta know you feel it
What do you see when you close your eyes
Cause you are on my mind
You're on my mind
You're on my mind all day and night, oh
Cause you are on my mind"

When the radio isn't on you can hear the songs
A guided light on the dark road your walking on
A signpost to find the dreams you thought was gone
Someone to help you move the obstacles you stumbled on
Someone to help you rebuild after the rubble's gone

Justin Timberlake,Not a Bad Thing,"Said all I want from you is to see you tomorrow
And every tomorrow, maybe you'll let me borrow your heart
And is it too much to ask for every Sunday
If I were radical and every other day to start

I know people make promises all the time
Then they turn right around and break them
When someone cuts your heart open with a knife, while you beating
But I could be that guy to heal it over time
And I won't stop until you believe it
'Cause baby you're worth it

So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me
'Cause you might fuck around and find your dreams come true, with me
Spend all your time and your money just find out my love was free
So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
It's not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me

Now how about I'd be the last voice you hear at night?
And every other night for the rest of the nights that there are
Every morning I just wanna see you staring back at me
'Cause I know that's a good place to start

I know people make promises all the time
Then they turn right around and break them
When someone cuts your heart open with a knife, while you beating
Don't you know I could be that guy to heal it over time
And I won't stop until you believe it
'Cause baby you're worth it

So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me
'Cause you might fuck around and find your dreams come true, with me
Spend all your time and your money just find out my love was free
So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
It's not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
It's not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me

No I won't feel your mind, broken promises, and waste of time
And if you fall, you'll always land right in these arms
These arms of mine

So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me
'Cause you might fuck around and find your dreams come true, with me
Spend all your time and your money just find out my love was free
So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
It's not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me

If I had a pair of wings
I'd pick you up and fly you far away from here
And you'd put your worries upon my shoulders, my dear
Now I know I can't save you
From the troubles of the world
And this sounds like such a silly thing
But if I could I'd fly you away
On a big old pair of wings

And if I had a pair of wings
I'd pick you up and fly you far away from here
And we'd fly so high up in the sky
Where the stars are so clear
And then I could save you
From the troubles of the world
And all you'd have to pack is your heart to bring
And there we are, you and me
Flying on a big old pair of wings

We keep getting older, the world keeps getting colder
Tell me when did we lose our way?
It's so hard not to lose your mind in such crazy days
But if I had one wish I know what I'd wish for
There's only one thing that'll do
I'd fly away on this pair of wings with you
If I had a pair of wings
I'd scoop you up we'd fly away and disappear
Then you could put your worries upon my shoulders, my dear
And I know I can't save you
From the troubles of the world
I know this sounds like such a silly thing
But if I could I'd fly you away
On a big old pair of wings

Now if I had a pair of wings
I'd pick you up and fly you far away from here
And I could stay right by your side and keep you so near
And then I could save you form the troubles of the world
And all you'd have to pack is your heart to bring
And there we are, you and me
Flying on a big old pair of wings

We keep getting older, the world keeps getting colder
Tell me when did we lose our way?
It's so hard not to lose your mind in such crazy days
And if I had one wish I know what I'd wish for
There's only one thing that'll do
I'd fly away on this pair of wings with you
And if I had one wish I know what I'd wish for
There's only one thing that'll do
I'd fly away on this pair of wings with you
I said if I had one wish I know what I'd wish for
There's only one thing that'll do
I'd fly away on this pair of wings with you"
Bebe Rexha,Meant to Be (feat. Florida Georgia Line),"Baby lay on back and relax, kick your pretty feet up on my dash

So won't you ride with me, ride with me?
See where this thing goes
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby if it's meant to be

I don't need to be so uptight, but my heart's been hurt a couple times
By a couple guys that didn't treat me right
I ain't gon' lie, ain't gonna lie
'Cause I'm tired of the fake love, show me what you're made of
Boy make me believe
(But hold up girl don't you know you're beautiful?)
(And it's easy to see)

If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby just let it be
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby just let it be
So won't you ride with me, ride with me?
See where this thing goes
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby if it's meant to be

Maybe we don't
(Maybe we will)
Maybe we won't

If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be

Taylor Swift,Gorgeous,"Gorgeous

You should take it as a compliment
That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
You should think about the consequence
Of your magnetic field being a little too strong

And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us
He's in the club doing, I don't know what
You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much
(I hate you so much)

Whisky on ice, Sunset and Vine
You've ruined my life by not being mine

You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous

You should take it as a compliment
That I'm talking to everyone here but you
And you should think about the consequence
Of you touching my hand in the darkened room (dark room, dark room)

If you've got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her
But if you're single that's honestly worse
'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts

You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face

Till I was hers
But she was never mine
Yeah, I was reckless

She was a lesson
I had to learn

Would've left this world behind
Just to wake up by your side

Would've sold my soul
For a little more time
Would've waited a thousand nights

Would've sold my soul for a little more time

Or lose contact when you runnin' out of rum and you make a run

All of that tequila's a killer, little vodka
Break her off somethin' proper
Pop a cork and play spin the bottle

Punch drunk love, it's a fine line
Dom Pérignon, she the fine wine
Someone call 911, I'm runnin' out of time

He felt just like you
His arms, his lips
His promises were just as smooth
His grip, it fit though I'll admit that
Only you could make me feel the way you do
Though you know love is blind
And he just caught my eye

You know me, and honestly I'm better without ya
Don't you got me checking on my phone by the hour
Baby, I'm hoping and praying
My knees weak, I'm shaking
'Cause you know that I always needed saving

Now I'm fucking lonely, and you didn't want me
Trying to show me that you didn't own me
But all you do is leave me, fucking lonely
Knees on the concrete, cut up and bleeding
For no goddamn reason, but all you do is leave me
Fucking lonely
Leave me fucking lonely
Leave me fucking lonely
Leave me fucking lonely

The month was June
The smoky sun, our fatal run
It ended too soon
With tears as proof, 'cause all the carpets stained with juice
Blood on my shoes and you know love is blind
I can see it in your eyes

You know me, and honestly I'm better without ya
Don't you got me checking on my phone by the hour
Baby, I'm hoping and praying
My knees weak, I'm shaking
'Cause you know that I always needed saving

Bitch can't even say I miss you back over the fuckin' text
Every time you slept over my pad, you over fuckin' slept
Toni Braxton told me to breathe again, don't hold no fuckin' breath
Gave your ass directions to my heart, and your ass busted left
Climbin' up the money tree, the tree without the lover's nest
'Cause love birds are some busy bees
You fuck around, you stung again
And you didn't leave in your underwear
'Cause she didn't arrive in no underwear
Look baby, either love is blind or nothing's there because
I can't see the forest from the tree, the water from the sea
And I was starting to believe, but it's a forest full of dreams
I smoke forests full of weed, and call you when I see you
And when you leave, I hope you know you bring
This forest to his leaves, I'm fucking lonely

Won't somebody come take me home?

Won't you take me by the hand

Was it something I did?
Was it something you said?

In a city so dead
Held up so high
On such a breakable thread (Breakable thread)

You were all the things I thought I knew

Avril Lavigne,Sk8er Boi,"He was a boy, she was a girl
Can I make it any more obvious?
He was a punk, she did ballet
What more can I say?
He wanted her, she'd never tell
Secretly she wanted him as well
But all of her friends stuck up their nose
They had a problem with his baggy clothes

He was a skater boy
She said, ""See ya later, boy""
He wasn't good enough for her
She had a pretty face
But her head was up in space
She needed to come back down to Earth

Five years from now, she sits at home
Feeding the baby, she's all alone
She turns on TV, guess who she sees?
Skater boy rocking on MTV
She calls up her friends, they already know
And they've all got tickets to see his show
She tags along, stands in the crowd
Looks up at the man that she turned down

He was a skater boy
She said, ""See ya later, boy""
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a superstar
Slammin' on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?

He was a skater boy

Now he's a superstar
Slammin' on his guitar

Sorry, girl, but you missed out
Well tough luck, that boy's mine now
We are more than just good friends
This is how the story ends
Too bad that you couldn't see
See the man that boy could be
There is more than meets the eye
I see the soul that is inside

He's just a boy and I'm just a girl
Can I make it any more obvious?
We are in love, haven't you heard
How we rock each other's world?

I'm with the skater boy
I said, ""See ya later, boy
I'll be backstage after the show
I'll be at a studio
Singing the song we wrote
About a girl you used to know""

The Band Perry,If I Die Young,"If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Oh oh, oh oh

Lord, make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother
She'll know I'm safe with you when she stands under my colors
Oh and life ain't always what you think it ought to be, you know
Ain't even grey, but she buries her baby

The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

And I'll be wearing white when I come into your kingdom
I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger
I've never known the loving of a man
But it sure felt nice when he was holding my hand
There's a boy here in town, says he'll love me forever
Who would have thought forever could be severed by

The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

So put on your best, boys, and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done

A penny for my thoughts, oh no, I'll sell them for a dollar
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I've been singing
Funny when you're dead how people start listening

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Oh oh

The ballad of a dove
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears, keep them in your pocket
Save them for a time when you're really gonna need them, oh

The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

So put on your best, boys, and I'll wear my pearls"
Linkin Park,In The End,"(It starts with one)
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind; I designed this rhyme
To explain, in due time
All I know; time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal

Didn't look out below
Watched the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind; I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so (far)

Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you, pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you, pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter"
Linkin Park,Numb,"I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I've become so tired; so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly; afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart right in front of you

(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I've become so tired; so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

And I know I may end up failing too
But I know you were just like me
With someone disappointed in you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I've become so tired; so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there

Yeah, yeah
(I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it)

Rum pa pa pum, rum pa pum pum pum pum
Yeah I'm on the drum, yeah I'm on the snare drum
Yeah I'm on the beat cause the beat goes dumb
And I only spit heat cause I'm playin' for the Son
Playin' for the king, playin for the title
I'm surprised you didn't hear this in the Bible
I'm so tight, I might go psycho
Christmas time so here's a recital
I'm so bad like Michael, I know I'm still young but I go I go
Stupid stupid love like cupid
I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it

Little baby, pa rum pa pum pum
I am a poor boy too, pa rum pa pum pum

Bieber what up
Justin
Pa rum pa pum pum, pa rum pum, pa rum pum

Busta Rhymes
Lemme get straight to it. Yo
At the table with the family, havin' dinner
Blackberry on our hip and then it gave a little flicker
Then I took a look to see before it activates the ringer
Came to realize my homie Bieber hit me on the Twitter
Then I hit him back despite I had some food up on my finger
Sippin' eggnog with a little sprinkle of vanilla
Even though it's kinda cold, pullin' out a chinchilla
Bieber hit me back and said, ""Let's make it hot up in the winter.""
I said, ""Cool."" Ya know Imma deliver
Let's collaborate and make the holiday a little bigger
Before we work I gotta get this off
See the other family members and drop gifts off
Then I'm headed to the studio cause ain't nothing stopping how
You know we bout to turn it up and really get it poppin' now
People everywhere and all our Twitter followers
""Merry Christmas, Kwanza, happy Hanukkah! ""

Justin
Mary nodded, pa rum pa pum pum
The ox and lamb kept time, pa rum pa pum pum
I played my drum for him, pa rum pa pum pum (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I played my best for him, pa rum pa pum pum, pa pum pum, pa pum pum

If you wanna give, it's the time of year
JB on the beat, yeah yeah, I'm on the snare
It's crazy how some people say, say they don't care
When there's people on the street with no food; it's not fair
It's about time for you to act merrily
It's about time for you to give to charity
Rarely do people even wanna help at all
'Cause they warm by the fire, getting toys and their dolls
Not thinking there's a family out hungry and cold
Wishin', wishin' that they had somebody they could hold
So I think some of you need to act bold
Give a can to a drive, let's change the globe

Globe globe globe globe globe

You ain't gotta make your mind up.
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now.
I'll still.
Don't rush, no pressure.

Put my key in the ignition.
Don't rush it girl, just stretch it out for me.
I know that you ain't got no plans to leave.
Girl I need your attention.
And every time I see you make that face.
I wanna love you all over the place.
Don't do it, baby.
Don't do it to me, no.

I know you don't wanna talk, right.
We've been on and off like the crosslights.
You heard I'm playin' with them hoes like I golf, right?
When I touch you, I get frostbite.
Girl you're so cold, so cold, so cold.
How we so young but livin' so old?
In the bed together but we sleepin' solo.
That could drive you loco.
You supposed to me my uno, Yoko Ono.
Oh no, round two again.
We've been fighting more than Ryu and Ken
Last time we argued eight straight days.
I learned my lesson, I got straight As.
And I know it's deeper than masseuses.
Oh, you know I eat the cookie like I'm Lucious
Go ahead and take the time.
But it's a waste of time if your waist ain't on mine.
Think about it.

You ain't gotta make your mind up.
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now.
Right now, don't rush, no pressure.
You ain't gotta make your mind up.
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now.
I'll be waiting for you.
Don't rush, no pressure.
You ain't gotta make your mind up.
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now.
Right now, don't rush, no pressure.
You ain't gotta make your mind up.
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now.
I'll still.
Don't rush, no pressure.

You ain't gotta make your mind up right now.
I know I did you wrong.
Let your heart heal.
Don't rush, no pressure."
Justin Bieber,No Sense,"It don't make no sense 'less I'm doing it with you
It don't make no sense 'less I'm doing it with you

The sun don't set the same
'Less you're watching it go down with me
The bed won't sleep the same
'Less you're waking up in here with me
Oh, my heart's a vacant house
When you're gone away, it's so empty
And love don't make no sense when it's empty (Oh no)

I've driven almost every car
It ain't the same when I'm without you
Been around a million stars
None of them shine brighter than you
The sky be so dark now without you
Yeah, ooh, baby

It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
Oh been around the world
Ain't the same without you
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you

Focus ain't the same
If the picture ain't got you in it
In every line my
Emotions ain't the same
If it ain't about you, I don't get it
Ever since the beginning now
You had that effect on me
All I wanna do is you, oh
I mean that so literally
Don't nobody go harder than you
All of the angels must be lonely now, without you, whoa

It don't make sense, no
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
'Less I'm doing it with you baby
It don't make no sense

I only want to hear your voice, yeah

'Less I'm doing it with you
(Way up, way up, way up)
(Yeah, slow down stay up, stay up, stay up)
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you

Time and time again I break a plan
Without you, girl I ain't the man
Could never be all I can be
You overstand, I'm incomplete
Apparently, gotta know I hate that
How I'm supposed to take that?
Boo'd up, missing all of that
Gotta be laying in that
Rolled up, put a flame to that
Thought by now you would have made it back
Be patient
Won't you pull up to me now?
Live forever young
It's amazing
I don't want to sleep 'less you at home

It don't make sense, no
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
No, It don't make sense

Justin Bieber,The Feeling,"You are to me
A part of me just like anatomy
You're pulling me
You're pulling me in like you're gravity

I'm notorious for thinking you're full of beautiful
Instead of hollow
Sugar on your lips, it's hard to kill
Jagged like a pill, so hard to swallow

Am I in love with you? Am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
Trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth
Sometimes the heart is deceiving
Can't get out of my head, I need you to save me
If I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy
In love with you, am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?

You give to me
Everything, anything that I could dream
And at least that's what it seems
Could it be I don't know what's good for me?

I'm notorious for thinking you're full of beautiful
Instead of hollow
Sugar on your lips, it's hard to kill
Jagged like a pill, so hard to swallow

Am I in love with you? Am I in love with you?

Trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth
Sometimes the heart is deceiving
Can't get out of my head, I need you to save me
If I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy
In love with you, am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?

I'm sinking faster and faster
Between heaven and disaster
Sorry if I made you feel like
I'm standing on the borderline

Am I in love with you? Am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
Trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth
Sometimes the heart is deceiving
Can't get out of my head, I need you to save me

Justin Bieber,Life Is Worth Living,"Ended up on a crossroad
Try to figure out which way to go
It's like you're stuck on a treadmill
Running in the same place
You got your hazard lights on now
Hoping that somebody would slow down
Praying for a miracle
Who'll show you grace?
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas
With a long journey ahead
Seen a truck pull over
God sent an angel to help you out
He gave you direction
Showed you how to read a map
With a long journey ahead
Said it ain't over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again

Relationship on a ski slope
Avalanche comin' down slow
Do we have enough time to salvage this love?
Feels like a blizzard in April
'Cause my heart is just that cold
Skating on thin ice
But it's strong enough to hold us up
Seen her scream and holler
Put us both on blast
Tearing each other down
When I thought it was over
God sent us an angel to help us out
He gave us direction, showed us how to make it last
For that long journey ahead
Said it ain't ever over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again
Life is worth living again

What I'd give for my affection
Is a different perception
From what the world may see
They try to crucify me
I ain't perfect, won't deny
My reputation's on the line
So I'm working on a better me

Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes
Only God can judge me
Life is worth living again
Another day
Life is worth living again"

Justin Bieber,Purpose,"Feeling like I'm breathing my last breath
Feeling like I'm walking my last steps
Look at all of these tears I've wept
Look at all the promises that I've kept

I put my heart into your hands
Here's my soul to keep
I let you in with all that I can
You're not hard to reach
And you bless me with the best gift
That I've ever known
You give me purpose
Yeah, you've given me purpose

Thinking my journey's come to an end
Sending out a farewell to my friends, forever peace
Ask you to forgive me for my sins, oh would you please?
I'm more than grateful for the time we spent, my spirit's at ease

I put my heart into your hands
Learn the lessons you teach
No matter what, wherever I am
You're not hard to reach
And you've given me the best gift
That I've ever known
You give me purpose everyday
You give me purpose in every way

Oh, you are my everything
Oh, you are my everything

I don't know if this is wrong because someone else is telling me that it's wrong but I feel this so let me just like, try my best not to let this happen again. We weren't necessarily put in the best position to make the best decisions.

You can't be hard on yourself for these were the cards that you were given so you have to understand that these, like... that's not who you are. You're trying to be the best you can be but that's all you can do. If you don't give it all you got, you're only cheating yourself. Give it all you got, but if it ends up happening, it ends up happening.

That's what it's... that's what's happening with me. It's like God I'm giving it all I got, sometimes I'm weak and I'm gonna do it, and it's like I'm not giving myself grace, I'm just like understanding, that's just how it is."
Justin Bieber,We Are,"Happy birthday.

You ain't gotta question it.
You already know the answer.
The truth don't make us relevant.
Hurts but it's necessary.
Don't want us to lose what we are
Don't want us to lose what we are.
Lose what we are.

If it ain't broke then we don't need to fix it.
Believing in what she say'll have you livid.
Know they won't be happy till our love is over.
They tryna break us up but you don't wanna get it.

They ain't ever had trust like how we got it.
They ain't never had a chance how you got it.
So they can't help but to come and hate on it.
They see what we got and you know they want it, don't question it.

You ain't gotta question it.
You already know the answer.
The truth don't make us relevant.
Hurts but it's necessary.
Don't want us to lose what we are.

Lose what we are.

It's like you're always looking for a problem.
The raining of equations for you to solve 'em.
So quick to turn nothin' right into somethin'.
Get the numbers out my phone, go 'head and call 'em.

They ain't ever had trust like how we got it.
They ain't never had a chance how you got it.
So they can't help but to come and hate on it.
They see what we got and you know they want it, don't question it.

Lose what we are.

She texts me ""How's you love life?"" and ""How are you?"", I said ""I'm good"".
They only get as close as you allow them to.
We should be closer together, warm oceans, better weather.
Instead of us playing games forever, she says whatever.
I says whatever, who get you wetter than a half moon wearer.
HSTRY sweater, serendipity when you with me.
Swear you love that one thing we did that one time in that one place.
Blew your mind, you got my mind going when I'm home.
I'm serious girl, a much older dude, a whole 42.
I've accomplished my goals, it's only you.
You and I in that Wraith, retire my pimp super-fly cape.
Just my Mets cap and my badge and I'm straight.
Esco.

You ain't gotta question it.

Don't let this effort go to waste
Put our all in it
Don't want to be left with the questions, why
Let's be honest with ourselves
Did we really come this far
Just to watch it go down the drain?

Yeah, sometimes the heart what's invisible to the eye
All you gotta do is listen to your deepest feelings
They don't ever lie
Well giving up is immature
There's so much more to live for
That I want to see us together now
'Cause we're strong enough to endure, whoa

If I believe in love and you believe in love
Then we can be in love, somehow
If you want the best for us

Don't think we should separate
And we both adore one another
You're a dream come true
We should start off brand new
That's what we ought to do

If you got a twenty for all of your tries
Twenty for all of the times, the times you got back up, whoa
You'd be a billionaire in a year
That's what you gotta think till you're there, on the record line

If you got a diamond for all of your passion, diamond for your dedication
You could be icy like cake and icy for every occasion, gotta go hard, yeah
Still don't condone it, love is a component
You're the only opponent, gotta seize the moment

And don't do nothin' 'less your heart's in it
Heart's in it, heart's in it
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it

All in it, all in it

Baby, I had a good time, and yes I pop strings
A guitar with only one string, I can only play one song, ooh
A simple melody, simple enough to make the world sing
Strong enough to make your mood swing, you know what I mean

If you got a diamond for all of your passion, diamond for your dedication
You could be icy like cake and icy for every occasion, gotta go hard, yeah

Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it

All in it, all in it

She growing up aight
I always felt like I had to be the best at everything
Because I, I just didn't think I wasn't good enough
And maybe if I was good at something, that I'd get recognition from that
But I quickly found out that
I wasn't going to get the recognition that I wanted or that I needed
Because, because people aren't perfect
And, by not being perfect you, you sometimes can disappoint people
And with God, it's like he's perfect and he never disappoints
So I just get my recognition from him
And give him recognition"

Alessia Cara,Scars To Your Beautiful,"She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain and cut her woes away
'Cause covergirls don't cry after their face is made

But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

She has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving
You know, covergirls eat nothing
She says ""beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything""
""What's a little bit of hunger?""
""I could go a little while longer,"" she fades away
She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface
So to all the girls that's hurting
Let me be your mirror, help you see a little bit clearer
The light that shines within

There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

No better you than the you that you are
No better you than the you that you are
No better life than the life we're living
No better life than the life we're living
No better time for your shine, you're a star
No better time for your shine, you're a star
Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful

And there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful"

Little Mix,Secret Love Song,"When you hold me in the street 
And you kiss me on the dance floor 
I wish that it could be like that 
Why can't it be like that? 'Cause I'm yours

We keep behind closed doors
Every time I see you, I die a little more
Stolen moments that we steal as the curtain falls
It'll never be enough

It's obvious you're meant for me
Every piece of you, it just fits perfectly
Every second, every thought, I'm in so deep
But I'll never show it on my face

But we know this, we got a love that is hopeless

Why can't you hold me in the street?
Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor?
I wish that it could be like that
Why can't we be like that? 'Cause I'm yours

When you're with him, do you call his name,
Like you do when you're with me? Does it feel the same?
Would you leave if I was ready to settle down?
Or would you play it safe and stay?

Girl you know this, we got a love that is hopeless

Why can't you hold me in the street?
Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor?
I wish that it could be like that
Why can't we be like that? 'Cause I'm yours

And nobody knows I'm in love with someone's baby
I don't wanna hide us away
Tell the world about the love we're making
I'm living for that day, someday

Why can't I hold you in the street?
Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor?
I wish that we could be like that
Why can't we be like that? 'Cause I'm yours, I'm yours!

Oh, why can't you hold me in the street?
Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor?
I wish that it could be like that
Why can't it be like that? 'Cause I'm yours

Why can't I say that I'm in love?
I wanna shout it from the rooftops
I wish that it could be like that
Why can't we be like that? 'Cause I'm yours

Why can't we be like that?
Wish we could be like that"
Hailee Steinfeld,Most Girls,"Some girls, feel best in their tiny dresses
Some girls, nothin' but sweatpants, looking like a princess
Some girls, kiss new lips every single night
They're stayin' out late 'cause they just celebrating life

You know some days you feel so good in your own skin
But it's okay if you wanna change the body that you came in
'Cause you look greatest when you feel like a damn queen
We're all just playing a game in a way, trying to win at life

Most girls are smart and strong and beautiful
Most girls, work hard, go far, we are unstoppable
Most girls, our fight to make every day

Shawn Mendes,Imagination,"Oh, there she goes again
Every morning, it's the same
You walk on by my house
I wanna call out your name

I wanna tell you how beautiful you are
From where I'm standing
You've got me thinking what we could be 'cause

I keep craving, craving you, don't know it but it's true
Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you
This is typical of love, I can't wait anymore, I won't wait
I need to tell you how I feel when I see us together forever

In my dreams, you're with me
We'll be everything I want us to be
And from there, who knows?
Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time
Or is that just me and my imagination?

We walk, we laugh, we spend our time
Walking by the ocean side
Our hands are gently intertwined
A feeling I just can't describe

And all this time we spent alone
Thinking we could not belong 
To something so damn beautiful, so damn beautiful

I keep craving, craving you, don't know it but it's true
Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you
This is typical of love, I can't wait anymore, I won't wait
I need to tell you how I feel when I see us together forever

In my dreams, you're with me
We'll be everything I want us to be
And from there, who knows?
Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time
Or is that just me and my imagination?

Justin Bieber,Been You,"Feeling the remnants, got it in an instance
Blink of an eye, no goodbye
I had a notion deep as the ocean
Blue like the sky, oh my

Like a permanent stain 
Wishing I could just wash away, away
Prayed our love wasn't vain
Who was to blame for all the pain? For all the pain?

If I would've known, if I would've known
If I would have known it could have been you
If I had the chance, if I had the chance I'd make us brand new
I never wanted to be, wanted to be your remnants
No, but if I, if I would've known
If I would have known it could have been you, been you

There are percussions, I'm missing your loving
Must be the night, the ghost of a life
All of the memories
A serenity dwindling my mind
All the time

Like a permanent stain 
Wishing I could just wash away, away
Prayed our love wasn't vain
Who was to blame for all the pain? For all the pain?

If I would've known, if I would've known
If I would have known it could have been you
If I had the chance, if I had the chance I'd make us brand new
I never wanted to be, wanted to be your remnants
No, but if I, if I would've known
If I would have known it could have been you, been you

If I would've known, if I would've known
If I would have known it could have been you

Ed Sheeran,All Of The Stars,"It's just another night
And I'm staring at the moon
I saw a shooting star and thought of you
I sang a lullaby
By the waterside and knew
If you were here, I'd sing to you
You're on the other side
As the skyline splits in two
Miles away from seeing you
But I can see the stars
From America
I wonder, do you see them too?

So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will leave
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home

I can hear your heart
On the radio beat
They're playing ""Chasing Cars"" and I thought of us
Back to the time
You were lying next to me
I looked across and fell in love
So I took your hand
Back through lamp-lit streets and dew
Everything led back to you
So can you see the stars
Over Amsterdam?
Hear the song our heart is beating to

So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will leave
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home

And oh
And oh
And oh

I can see the stars
From America"
Charlie Puth,Dangerously,"This is gonna hurt but I blame myself first, 'cause I ignored the truth
Drunk off that love, my head up, there's no forgetting you
You've awoken me, but you're choking me, I was so obsessed
Gave you all of me, and now honestly I've got nothing left

I loved you dangerously
More than the air that I breathe
Knew we would crash at the speed that we were going
Didn't care if the explosion ruined me
Baby I loved you dangerously
I loved you dangerously

Usually I hold the power with both my hands tied behind my back
Look at how things change, cause now you're the train, and I'm tied to the track
You've awoken me, but you're choking me, I was so obsessed
Gave you all of me, and now honestly I've got nothing left

'Cause I loved you dangerously
More than the air that I breathe
Knew we would crash at the speed that we were going
Didn't care if the explosion ruined me
Baby I loved you dangerously

You took me down, down, down, down
And kissed my lips quick goodbye
I see you now, now, now, now
It was a matter of time
You know I know, there's only one place this could lead
But you are the fire, I'm gasoline

I love you, I love you, I love you, I loved you dangerously
More than the air that I breathe
Oh now, I knew we would crash at the speed that we were going
Didn't care if the explosion ruined me
Oh, oh baby I loved you dangerously

Oh, I loved you dangerously
Oh, oh, I loved you dangerously"

To the break of day

Macklemore,Good Old Days (feat. Kesha),"I wish somebody would have told me, babe
Someday, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
Someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of these good old days

I was thinkin' 'bout the band
I was thinkin' 'bout the fans
We were underground
Loaded merch in that 12-passenger van
In a small club in Minnesota
And the snow outside of 1st Ave
I just wanted my name in a star
Now look at where we at
Still growin' up, still growin' up
I would lay in my bed and dream about what I'd become
Couldn't wait to get older, couldn't wait to be some
Now that I'm here, wishing I was still young
Those good old days

I wish somebody would have told me, babe
That someday, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
'Cause someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of the good old days

Wish I didn't think I had the answers
Wish I didn't drink all of that flask first
Wish I made it to homecoming
Got up the courage to ask her
Wish I would've gotten out of my shell
Wish I put the bottle back on that shelf
Wish I wouldn't have worry about what other people thought
And felt comfortable in myself
Rooftop open, and the stars above
Moment frozen, sneakin' out, and fallin' in love
Me, you and that futon, we'd just begun
On the grass dreamin', figuring out who I was
Those good old days

I wish somebody would have told me, babe
That someday, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
'Cause someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of the good old days

Never thought we'd get old, maybe we're still young
Maybe you always look back and think it was better than it was
Maybe these are the moments
Maybe I've been missin' what it's about
Been scared of the future, thinkin' about the past
While missin' out on now
We've come so far, I guess I'm proud
And I ain't worried 'bout the wrinkles 'round my smile
I've got some scars, I've been around
I've felt some pain, I've seen some things, but I'm here now
Those good old days

You don't know what you've got
'Til it goes, 'til it's gone
You don't know what you've got
'Til it goes, 'til it's gone

I wish somebody would have told me, babe
Someday, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
Someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of these good old days"

But it was just a dream.

When you will have to rise
Above the best and prove yourself
Your spirit never dies.

Farewell, I've gone
To take my throne above
But don't weep for me
'Cause this will be the labour of my love

This city never sleeps at night

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am

So this is where you fell
And I am left to sell
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell
Right to the top
Don't look back
Turning to rags and giving the commodities a raincheck

I don't ever want to let you down
I don't ever want to leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am

This road never looked so lonely
This house doesn't burn down slowly
To ashes, to ashes

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am"

Visions of, visions of you
I keep getting stuck in this day
Stuck in this déjà-vu

It's like I'm never riding solo
I feel you walking in my shadow
Never hit me quite like that though

Late nights and I can't sleep
Choked up and I can't breathe

Taylor Swift,Gorgeous,"Gorgeous

You should take it as a compliment
That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
You should think about the consequence
Of your magnetic field being a little too strong

And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us
He's in the club doing, I don't know what
You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much
(I hate you so much)

Whisky on ice, Sunset and Vine
You've ruined my life by not being mine

You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous

You should take it as a compliment
That I'm talking to everyone here but you
And you should think about the consequence
Of you touching my hand in the darkened room (dark room, dark room)

If you've got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her
But if you're single that's honestly worse
'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts
(Honey, it hurts)

Ocean blue eyes looking in mine
I feel like I might sink and drown and die

You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?

There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad
You make me so happy it turns back to sad, yeah
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
Guess I'll just stumble on home to my cats

Alone
Unless you wanna come along
Oh

You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face

And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?

Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (oh)

But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

I don't like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You ask me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast (what?)

The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours

But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time

Diddy - Dirty Money,Coming Home,"(Skylar)
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away
All the pain of yesterday

I know my kingdom awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming

(Diddy)
I'm back where I belong
Yeah I never felt so strong
I'm feelin' like there's nothing that I can't try
(I'm back, baby)
And if you with me put your hands high
(Put your hands high)

If you ever lost a life before, this one's for you
(And if you with me put your hands high)
And you, and you and you and you
(Your dreams are filled, you're rapping with the best)

I hear ""The Tears Of A Clown"", I hate that song
I feel like they talking to me when it comes on
Another day another dawn
Another Keisha, nice to meet ya, get the math, I'm gone

What am I 'posed to do when the club lights come on
It's easy to be Puff, but it's harder to be Sean
What if the twins ask why I ain't marry they mom?
(Why? Damn)
How do I respond?

What if my son stares with a face like my own
And says he wants to be like me when he's grown
Damn, but I ain't finished growin'
Another night the inevitable prolongs

Another day, another dawn
Just tell Keisha and Teresa I'll be better in the morn'
Another lie that I carry on
I need to get back to the place I belong

(Skylar)
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away
All the pain of yesterday

I know my kingdom awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming

(Diddy)
""A house Is Not A Home"", I hate this song
Is a house really a home when your loved ones is gone?
And people got the nerve to blame you for it
And you know you woulda took the bullet if you saw it

But you felt it and still feel it
And money can't make up for it or conceal it
But you deal with it and you keep ballin'
Pour out some liquor, play boy, and we keep ballin'

Baby, we've been living in sin 'cause we've been really in love
But we've been living as friends
So you've been a guest in your own home
It's time to make your house your own, pick up your phone, come on

(Skylar)
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away
All the pain of yesterday

I know my kingdom awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming

(Diddy)
""Ain't No Stopping Us Now"", I love that song
Whenever it comes on it makes me feel strong
I thought I told y'all that we won't stop
Till back cruising through Harlem, Viso blocks

It's what made me, saved me, drove me crazy
Drove me away than embraced me, forgave me
For all of my shortcomings, welcome to my homecoming
Yeah it's been a long time coming

Lot of fights, lot of scars
Lot of bottles, lot of cars
Lot of ups, lot of downs
Made it back, lost my dog
(I miss you Big)

And here I stand, a better man
(A better man)
Thank you Lord
(Thank you Lord)

(Skylar)
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away
All the pain of yesterday

I know my kingdom awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming"
Eminem,Walk On Water (feat. Beyoncé),"I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes (fuck)

Why are expectations so high?
Is it the bar I set? My arms I stretch, but I can't reach
A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp
But as soon as I grab, squeeze

I lose my grip like the flyin' trapeze
Into the dark I plummet, now the sky's blackening
I know the mark's high, butter-flies rip apart my stomach
Knowin' that no matter what bars I come with
You're gonna harp, gripe, and that's a hard Vicodin to swallow
So I scrap these as pressure increases like khakis
I feel the ice cracking, because

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
(It’s the curse of the— it’s the curse of the—)
I walk on water (shit)
But only when it freezes

It's the curse of the standard that the first of the Mathers discs set
Always in search of the verse that I haven't spit yet
Will this step just be another misstep
To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect

I've garnered? The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless
And it always feels like I'm hittin' the mark
Till I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart
Like, ""This shit is garbage!""
And God's given me all this
Still I feel no different regardless
Kids look to me as a god, this is retarded
If only they knew, it's a facade and it's exhaustive

And I try not to listen to nonsense
But if you bitches are tryin' to strip me of my confidence
Mission accomplished
I'm not God-sent, Nas, Rakim, Pac, B.I.G., James Todd Smith, and I'm not Prince

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water (it's true, it's true)
But only when it freezes

'Cause I'm only human, just like you
Making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh

It's true, I'm a Rubik's, a beautiful mess
At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest
A flawed human, I guess
But I'm doin' my best to not ruin your ex-

Pectations and meet 'em, but first the ""Speedom"" verse
Now Big Sean he's goin' too fast, is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?
There was a time I had the world by the balls, eatin' out my palm
Every album song I was spazzin' the fuck out on
And now I'm gettin' clowned and frowned on
But the only one who's looking down on me that matters now's DeShaun
Am I lucky to be around this long?

Begs the question though, especially after the methadone
As yesterday fades and the Dresden home
Is burnt to the ground, and all that's left of my house is lawn
The crowds are gone
And it's time to wash out the blonde
Sales decline, the curtain's drawn
They're closin' the set, I'm still pokin' my head from out behind
And everyone who has doubt, remind

Now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times
Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares or gives a fuck about your rhymes
And as I grow outta sight, outta mind, I might go outta mine
'Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight
When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?

But when I do fall from these heights though, I'll be fine
I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine
But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around, 'cause

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

'Cause I'm only human, just like you
I've been making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh
If I walked on water, I would drown

'Cause I'm just a man
But as long as I got a mic, I'm godlike
So me and you are not alike
Bitch, I wrote ""Stan"""
Dr. Dre,I Need A Doctor,"Skylar Grey:
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm running out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

Eminem:
I told the world, one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape and lay it, record it so that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm sayin' that
Doubt's startin' to creep in, every day is just so gray and black

Hope, I just need a ray of that
'Cause no one see's my vision when I play it for 'em, they just say it's whack
But they don't know what dope is, and I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is, you came to me when I was at my lowest

You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son, demons fightin' you
It's dark, let me turn on the lights and brighten it and enlighten you

I don't think you realize what you mean to me, not the slightest clue
'Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick you
Gon' either wanna fight, when I get off this fuckin' mic or you
Gon' hug me, but I'm out of options, there's nothin' else I can do, 'cause

Skylar Grey:
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm running out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

Eminem:
It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces so I'm puzzled, 'cause the shit I hear is
Crazy, but you're either getting lazy or you don't believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form

Can't make a decision, you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin', and it's almost like your beggin' for my help
Like I'm your leader, you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
I can endure, no more I demand you remember who you are

It was you, who believed in me, when everyone was tellin' you
Don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy, Dre I'm cryin' in this booth

You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I could never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith, and you ain't givin' up on me
Get up Dre, I'm dyin' I need you, come back for fuck's sake, 'cause

Skylar Grey:
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm running out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

Dr. Dre:
It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday, though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoked

Went through friends, some of 'em I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin' to the death, but where the fuck are they now
Now that I need them, I don't see none of them all I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him

Fuckin' backstabbers, when the chips were down, you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots
You gon' see us in our lab jackets, and ask where the fuck we been
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots

And the crackers' ass, little Cracker Jack beat makin'
Whack, ass-backwards producers, I'm back bastards
One more CD and then I'm packin' up my bags, and as I'm leavin'
I'll guarantee they'll scream ""Dre don't leave us like that man,"" 'cause

Skylar Grey:
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm running out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life"

'Cause I'm only human, just like you
I've been making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh
If I walked on water, I would drown

'Cause I'm just a man
But as long as I got a mic, I'm godlike
So me and you are not alike
Bitch, I wrote ""Stan"""
Eminem,Believe,"And I started from the bottom
Like a snowman, ground-up
Like round chuck and still put hands on you
Stayin' wound up is how I spend time
Sucker free, confidence high
Such a breeze when I pen rhymes
I just got the air about me like wind chimes (yeah)

Another day in the life (uh)
Used to have to scrape to get by (yeah)
Now my community's gated and I
Made it and my neighbors say hi
I'm givin' 'em pounds, I'm upscale now
Guess it means I'm way in the sky

But I still remember the days of
Minimum wage for general labor
Welfare recipient since a minor
Look how government assistance has made ya
Adversity, if at first you don't succeed
Put your temper to more use
'Cause bein' broke's a poor excuse

That should only give you more fuel
Show 'em why you're you
So close, God, it's like I almost got it
But close only counts in time bombs and horseshoes
So I Unabomb shit-tick, tick, tick-no remorse, pew
Screw it, I'm lit, and that attitude I blew up on quick
That's why they call me firecracker
I grew up on wick-wick, wick, wick-with a short fuse
I got some important news to report to
Anyone who thought I was done: nah bitch, not quite
Spotlight's back on, got my faith, where's yours?

Do you still believe in me?
Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now and walk out
I will never let you live it down
(I'll never quit) Do you still believe in me?

Man, I know sometimes
These thoughts can be harsh and cold as ice
To me they're just ink blots
I just fling 'em like slingshots and so precise

So you might want to think it over twice
When you retards can roll the dice
But beef will at least cost you your career
'Cause even my cheap shots are overpriced

But this middle finger's free as a bird
Nuke warheaded birth, hugest forehead on Earth
Too short for the verse, studied his formula, learned
How to incorporate a curse
Point it towards corporate America

Stick a fork in and turn
'Cause four-letter words are more better heard
The world force-fed a turd to me
You're gettin' yours

But sometimes I overdo it, but I just get so into it
I was there consolin' you when no one knew it
When your situation showed no improvement
I was that door, you walked over to it
I'm the light at the end of tunnel
So people are always lookin' at me as they're goin' through it

When that tunnel vision is unclear
Shit becomes too much to bear
Since ""Cleanin' Out My Closet""
When I was havin' trouble with the snare

I'm that unrealistic prayer answered
And I'ma get you jacked up
Like you're tryin' to fix a flat, uh
When you struggle with despair
That double-fisted, bare-knuckles coupled with this pair
Of nuts I'm cuppin', I am your fuckin' switch, nothin' can compare

Do you still believe in me?
Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now
And walk out, I will never let you live it down
(I'll never quit) Do you still believe in me?

Started from the bottom like a snowman
Oh man, put that in your corncob pipe and smoke that
But my battery's low, I'ma need a boost to my pack
And I know that I always got Proof at my back
I called you ""Proof"" because I knew for a fact

My ace in the hole, homie, I'm callin' on you
'Cause I think I'm slowly startin' to lose faith in it, so
Give me that apron and mo-
-Tivation to go, Hussein with the flow
Fake fans left you two-faced at the show
Let heartbeats loop, produce hate in my soul
Layin' vocals two days in a row

True statement, hate to go down this road
But there's only one route to cross this bridge
So I walk in this bitch with loose change
'Cause all my dues paid, but this booth's takin' its toll

But it's never too late to start a new beginning
That goes for you too, so what the fuck you gon' do?
Use the tools you're given
Or you're gon' use the cards you're dealt
As an excuse for you to not do shit with 'em?
I used to play the loser/victim
Till I saw the way Proof was driven

I found my vehicle and I haven't ran out of gas yet
And when they stacked decks, turn handicaps into assets
Fanny packs, hourglasses
If time was on my side, I'd still have none to waste
Man, in my younger days
That dream was so much fun to chase

It's like I run in place
While this shit dangled in front of my face
But how do you keep up the pace
And the hunger pains once you've won the race?

When that fuel exhaust is coolin' off
'Cause you don't got nothin' left to prove at all
'Cause you done already hit 'em with the coup de grâce
Still you feel the need to go full tilt
That Bruce Willis, that Blue Steel, that true skill
When that wheel's loose, I won't lose will
Do you still believe?"
Eminem,Chloraseptic (feat. Phresher),"Instinctive nature to bring the anguish (yeah)
To the English language
With this ink, you haters get rode on like a piece of paper
This rap shit got me travellin' place to place
You barely leave your house
'Cause you're always stuck at your pad, it's stationary

Yeah, that's why when I brainstorm, gotta write it out
Simon Cowell of rhymin' foul, that's why you sound so shook
Wire bound notebook got tied around your throat
Hook it inside your mouth, go-hruh
That's what it's like when the mic is out

'Cause I'm tearin' at your flesh with it
Till your larynx and neck are split
With these lyrics, weapons, expert with
Like hair extensions, extra clips
And you're scared to effin' death of it
Bitch, you're starin' at a legend, that
In a pair of Skechers, sweatshirt ripped
And hoodie black, should be strapped

To a chair or stretcher, electric, swear on every record, bitch
Finger so high in the air, I'll bet your senses flip
Like a barometric pressure switch
Carin' less who I offend with this
I'm at your neck like Pez dispense
Go 'head, spit your flow, bitch

I'm at your throat like chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with, 'plex with
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah

And I'll take a hundred of you, hundred of you
All at once like I had nothin' to lose, what can I do?
My appetite for destruction is loose, destruction is loose
And all it wants is to have somethin' to chew
Somethin' to chew (somethin' to chew)

Yeah, uh, and still conjoined at
The hip with hop, still on point and poignant
Skilled as Floyd is
In this field, and still no filter, boy
I'll put you in your place (yeah) like a realtor, boy
You still ain't in the building, boy

I will destroy shit, even as I build it
Get the drillbit, pen is filled with poison
Which is the source, easy to still pinpoint it
(Like what?) Like a real thin joint it
(What?) Comes on Quilted Northern
(And what?) In a built-in toilet
(Yeah) Bitch, I told you I'm a dog (woof)

I wouldn't heal with ointment
Way I'm kickin' these fairies tales
Should write a children's storybook (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Million voices in my head
But still get a little bit of thrill and some real enjoyment
(Off what?) Off the feel of going in
(Like?) Like your bitch when she gives me brain

Like she thinks I'm dumb
Grabs the crown of my dick and blows me to kingdom come
Till I feel anointed
She makes iller noises
When she's with me, must be from the Windy City
Pretty apparent, she's a MILF when blowin' me

'Cause I conned her into
Rippin' the condom in two (woo)
Dick is a bargaining tool
Now I'm gettin' blew like Klonopins, Rude Jude
I go there, you wouldn't?
Well, I still have a few views in common with you
Just not YouTube, 'cause

I'm at your throat like chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with, 'plex with
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah

You're a has-been
That has been the case since back when
You last went and threw your hat in the race
You've been trash, stick your raps in the trash bin
Or end up in my next rhyme
You're a fuckboy, so next time
It's gonna be heads flyin' like Dez Bryant
With a TEC-9 against Rex Ryan (yeah)

Now watch me set it like correct time
All you get is sloppy seconds like a Timex, I
Clock rejects into the next life
Talkin' reckless, but it's just my
Strongest suit, but you can get my Columbian neck tie
Prostitute, just climb in the Humvee and let's ride

Why you hitching at night?
I put an end to your life, sex crime
Kidding aside, insidious vibe
Girl, you know you got the prettiest eyes
But all you're getting is bribe
Ending your life to try to get you inside
Then we gon' end up spending the night
And I'm skinning your hide like an Indian tribe

What kind of nut drives a Budweiser truck
Finds a slut, tries to surprise her, cuffs, ties her up
Binds up, cuts, slices her twice?
But the muff diver must just like it rough
Fuck right in her vagina, blood
Flies up on the visor, like a geyser, uh
(Music, please)

Enthusiast of the roofie
Goal is to get a floozy inside the Jacuzzi
And have a loosey-goosey as Cool C is with an Uzi
But I am to rap what blue jeans mean to Bruce Springsteen
Glued we be, I'm truTV, you're too PG
I'm Schoolly D, you're Spoonie Gee

No diss there, just notice there
Are no similarities that we share
Besides the fact we breathe air
Happily married to rap and I'm glad that we buried
The hatchet and patched it up
Now I'm back to ratchet up my attack
And I'm at your motherfuckin' throat like

Chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with, 'plex with
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah

And I'll take a hundred of you, hundred of you
All at once like I had nothin' to lose, what can I do?
My appetite for destruction is loose, destruction is loose
And all it wants is to have somethin' to chew
Somethin' to chew (somethin' to chew)"
Eminem,Untouchable,"Hands up, officer don't shoot
Then pull your pants up, promise you won't loot
We may never understand each other, it's no use
We ain't ever gonna grasp what each other goes through

Black boy, black boy, we ain't gonna lie to you
Black boy, black boy, we don't like the sight of you
Pull up on the side of you
Window rolled down, 'profile'
Then we wonder why we see this side of you

Probably comin' from the dope house
We could let you slide but your tail light is blew out
We know you're hidin' that Heidi Klum
On you another drug charge, homie, it's back inside for you

And just in case a chase might ensue, we got that tried and true
Pistol drew right at you, we'd be delighted to unload it
In your back, then walk up and lay that taser on the side of you
Fucked up, but what the fuck am I to do?

I keep tellin' myself, keep doin' like you're doin'
No matter how many lives you ruin
It's for the red, white and blue
Time to go find a new one and split his head right in two
No one's ever indicted you
Why? 'Cause you're a

White boy, white boy, you're a rockstar
(My mama talkin' to me, tryna tell me how to live)
White boy, white boy, in your cop car
(But I don't listen to her, 'cause my head is like a sieve)
White boy, white boy, you're untouchable
(The world's coming to an end, I don't even care)
Nobody can tell me shit 'cause I'm a (big rockstar)

Black boy, black boy, we don't get your culture and
We don't care what our government's done to fuck you over, man
Don't tell us your attitude's a result of that
Balderdash, where'd you get the chip on your shoulder at?

Why you kicking that soda can?
Pull your pants up, we 'bout to roll up and
Throw your ass in the van cuffed
You don't have to know our plans or what our intentions are
Our cards are close to our chest, you better show your hands

And put our minds more at ease
Or get shot in the thyroid, comply or die, boy
We're fightin' a crime war, here come the swine
Tryna clean up the streets from all these minorities

That's what we call 'em pigsties for
They're like eyesores to police
Talk to you like just a piece of trash
Feels like we're stuck in a time warp to me
As I kick these facts and get these mixed reactions
As this beat backspins, it's like we're drifting back in
To the sixties, having black skin is risky
'Cause this keeps happening
Throughout history, African-Americans have been treated like shit
And I admit, there have been times where it's been embarrassin' to be a

White boy, white boy, you're a rockstar
(My momma talkin' to me, tryna tell me how to live)
White boy, white boy, in your cop car
(But I don't listen to her, 'cause my head is like a sieve)
White boy, white boy, you're untouchable
(The world's coming to an end, I don't even care)
Nobody can tell me shit 'cause I'm a (big rockstar)

Seems like the average lifespan of a white man
Is more than twice than a black life span
I wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner
I feel like checking out on life, can't escape this circumstance

I'd rather hear 'em say ""Die N-word"" than Die Antwoord
Ninja, now it's better disguised banter
But that's life, strapped 'cause we're strapped financially
And can't find answers
We're applying, but McDonald's
Seems to be the only franchise that'll hire
So how can we have higher standards?

As Dallas overshadows the battle for Black Lives Matter
We fight back with violence but acts like that are
Black eyes on the movement
Which makes black lives madder
At cops and cops madder
That's why it's at a stalemate
And can't arrive at a compromise so it's Black Ops

I wonder if we hire more black cops, the crap stops
The block is our backyards, officers, not the crack spot
Call the attack dogs off of us, man
You always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop

And bad cops fuck it up for the good cops, and man, stop
Sendin' white cops into black neighborhoods
Who ain't acclimated to 'em, like that's the way to do it
Who seen some fuckin' videos of rappers waving guns
And know nobody black so they act afraid of us

And that's racism, the fear that a black face gives 'em
A subconscious racist
Wait, why are there black neighborhoods?
'Cause America segregated us, designated us to an area
Separated us, Section-Eight'd us
When we tear it up's the only time attention's paid to us
And education sucks, and every day's another
Freddie Gray for us, a levy breaks or fuzz

Why is it they treat us like dryer lint?
We just want a safe environment for our kids
But can't escape the sirens
Don't take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in
The poverty that we face so the crime rate's the highest in
The lowest classes, it's like a razor wire fence
And we're trapped in these racial biases
That plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise
Every time we see a devil's face

Lions, tigers and bears, oh my
It's more like billy clubs and gats
And we really love it when you think we're guilty 'cause we're black
""But you kill each other, facts
You peel each other's caps, for silly stuff like hats""

Single mother strugglin' through substance abuse
While people with nothin' to lose shoot each other for shoes
Fuck your Republican views
Pull ourselves up by our bootstraps, where the fuck are the boots?

And streets act as a narrator, don't gotta read comics
Or be that into characters, just to see that, just to be black
You better be strapped with a derringer
Or be ""capped in America"" like Steve Rogers

'Cause no one oversees these cops and
All we see is 'em beat charges
We done seen 'em beat Rodney King unconscious and got off
So we don't need all you crooked police officers' peace offerings

Just keep marchin', till we reach congress
But they're gonna say you're tryin' to take an irrational stance
If you try to slander the flag but
Somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb
So they call it a Kaepernick tantrum
If you don't stand for the national anthem

We raise it, you better praise it
Or you'll be made to feel like a traitor, we'll
Treat you like Rodney Dangerfield
Home of the brave is still racist 'ville
So this whole nation feels like a plantation field

In a country that claims that its foundation was based on United States ideals
That had its Natives killed
Got you singin' this star-spangled spiel
To a piece of cloth that represents the ""Land of the Free"" that made people slaves to build"
Eminem,Remind Me (Intro),"Damn girl
You drive me crazy
You may be crazy too
You make me do things
I normally wouldn't do

You make me feel things
That I never felt
You gotta be the real thing
'Cause you remind me of myself"
Eminem,Remind Me,"Yo
I bust in, devilish grin, disgustin'
Asshole, freckled cheeks and a butt chin
Calling all party animals
Get on the floor when I pop up on some Whac-A-Mole shit

In search of a chick who stacked them so thick
And implants are so big
She can hang me up on that rack, big ol' tits
Like Anna Nicole Smith
Body's bananas and sass to go wit'

I spot you at first glance and go ""Shit!""
You wearin' those pants that don't fit
That butt won't ever give up
That's why you stick it out no matter what
'Cause you got an ass that won't quit

So, get on the horn, my saxophone
Grab hold of my instrument, get a grasp, and blow
You just laugh and go, ""heehee""
'Cause you're just as nasty so that's appropriate
That's why

I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (yeah, me)
I said I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me, nasty (yeah, me)

You know, I'm wearin' a new shirt tonight too, yo
With me on it

I'm lookin' at your tight rear like a sightseer
Your booty is heavy duty like diarrhea
The plan's to bring you to my house
You're drinkin' Jack and Beam
I'm thinkin' soon as trampolines so we should bounce

But you're out of your tube-top
If you're thinkin' that mi casa es su casa
Yeah, you're a cute fox
Perfect ten so back that up like a moonwalk
Girl, you're smokin' like Snoop Dogg

But you must be tokin' if you think you're takin' over my quarters
There goes the dime into the jukebox
Two shots of blue Hpnotiq and soon I'll
Turn this pool hall to a barroom brawl
So, Rick, scratch on the break like the cue ball
Turn the volume all the way up on your boombox

And excuse the locker room talk, I'm just too raw
But apparently, so are you, ma
'Cause you just kicked me in the balls and told me to screw off
And that's why

I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (yeah, me)
I said I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me, nasty (yeah, me)

Said can I take you home, where we can be alone?
Shorty, you the shit
Girl, I ordered you to sit
I know you're probably feelin' me more than you admit
Pull up a chair, sweetie, let me order you a drink
I only go to meetings court-ordered from a shrink

So from the bottom to the top, floor to ceiling
You ain't run of the mill, you're one in a million
'Cause real tits are still fun
But everybody knows fake tits are still better than real ones

So come and spend the night with the guy most are terrified of
But tonight, curiosity overrides ya
Besides you're fire (I love) like a starter pistol
Crystal and slides huns, tonight I'm your pilot

'Cause you should be up in the sky, girl
You're so fucking fly, you belong in the mile high club
So come on, baby, the night's young
Don't string me along, I'm high-strung

We might wind it up, unbound like we're trying for the Cy Young
Fuckin' 'fore we get to the house, screwin' our brains out
Like changing a lightbulb
That's why I like ya, 'cause I'm crazy just like ya

Now every time I get brain, you screw mine up
I barely can think straight, your head game is a mindfuck
So ready, set, aim and fire
Yes, babe, I'm fallin' in likeness kinda, why

I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (yeah me)
I said I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me, nasty (yeah, me)"
Eminem,Revival (Interlude),"I've drowned in high from the ashes
Now I can't recall your laughter
The smoke of everything go grasp
At ends of what's left over

And the lights in every broken
Blown-out window screaming, laughing
I hope to feel it coursing out
This is our revival"
Eminem,Like Home (feat. Alicia Keys),"Yeah, shout to everybody
Who's been on this trip with me
You don't have to agree
But if you feel like me

Someone get this Aryan a sheet
Time to bury him, so tell him to prepare to get impeached
Everybody on your feet
This is where terrorism and heroism meet, square off in the street

This chump barely even sleeps
All he does is watch Fox News like a parrot and repeats
While he looks like a canary with a beak
Why you think he banned transgenders from the military with a tweet?

He's tryin' to divide us
The shit's like a cult, but like Johnny he'll only unite us
'Cause nothin' inside drives us like this fight does
Similar to when two cars collide 'cause

Our spirit's crushed, and this spot's a tight one
But here the jaws of life come
To pull us from the wreckage that's what we get pride from
When we can't wear stars and stripes

'Cause this type of pickle we're in is hard to deal
But there's always tomorrow still
If we start from the scratch like a scab, get the scars to heal
And band together for Charlottesville

And for Heather, fallen heroes, fill this wall with murals
Nevada get up, hit the damn resetter
Let's start from zero, this is our renewal
Spray tan, get ride of, get a brand new, better
America, and here's to where we're from

And here's to where we all began, all began (stand up)
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am (hands up)
Here's to the land that raised me
This one's for the only place that really knows me
From the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like home

Didn't wanna piss your base off, did ya?
Can't denounce the Klan, 'cause they play golf with ya
You stay on Twitter, way to get your hate off Nazi
I do not see a way y'all differ

And all you got are race cards, bigot
The swastika with your name carved in it
Should be your trademark, 'cause hate's all you played off
And you just lick the plate off
So I guess it pays to feed off of chaos
So basically, you ate off Hitler

But you ain't ruinin' our country, punk
Or takin' our pride from us, you won't define us
'Cause like a dictionary, things are lookin' up
So much, got a sprained neck, know we would rise up

Against this train wreck and take a stand
Even if it means sittin' when they raise the flag
To sing ""The Star-Spangled Banner"", this man
Just praised a statue of General Lee 'cause he generally

Hates the black people, degrades Hispanics
Take it back to the Shady national convention
Wish I woulda spit on it before I went
To shake his hand at the event

Or maybe had the wherewithal
To know that he was gonna try to tear apart
Our sacred land we cherish and stand for
So, hands in the air, let's hear it for
The start of a brand new America
Without him and be proud of where we're from
And here's to where we're from

And here's to where we all began, all began (stand up)
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am (hands up)
Here's to the land that raised me
This one for the only place that really knows me
From the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like home

I won't give up
I won't give up on my home, that so many died for
You already know that I won't give up
I won't give up on my home, that so many died for
You already know
There's no place like home, no place like home
Wherever I go, no place like home
No place like home, no place like home
Wherever I go

Here's to where we all began, all began (stand up)
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am (hands up)
Here's to the land that raised me
This one for the only place that really knows me
From the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like home"
Eminem,Bad Husband (feat. X Ambassadors),"We never saw from each other's sides or eye to eye
Just eye for eye, lie for lie, fight or flight
So much baggage, need a luggage rack
But we carry on with our public spats and our feuds
Up back in the news, love taps when I dissed you
Like it was fun, actually used to run back to the booth
Jump back in the studio, give you a tongue lashing, then you
Laughed at a stomach tat with the tomb stone
It was funny back in our youth
But then it wasn't after we knew
That we were done and actually through (and actually through)

But if there's one fraction of truth
If it could be spun back I would do
So many things different, 'cause it was such a dumbass excuse
You hit me once and that I would use
To continue the pattern of abuse
Why did I punch back? Girls, your dad is a scumbag, I'm confused
Because

How come you can be a lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband

You were the beat I loved with a writer's block
The line that's hot, that I forgot
We laughed a little, cried a lot
I'll never forget when you came home and you held Hailie
Day before you went to jail and daily
How we'd wait for that mail lady
Or by the phone for Mom to call

And I watched you pull yourself up and we decided on
Giving it one more try despite it all
You're my lightning rod when my sky gets dark
I'm your shiny rocks in that tiny box
When we tied the knot, when we broke the knot
Every line we crossed we were supposed to not
Every time we fought, the insults, they got thrown too far

Words that we said that we didn't mean
The words that we meant that we didn't say
The ones that we thought that we shoulda said
Letters written that we could have read
Which maybe woulda lead to some good instead
And had this put to bed
But I'd be lyin' still if I said
I wasn't sittin' here askin' myself

How come you can be a lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband (Dad) (you said)
Forever be a hero in my eyes (I reply)
But there's always another side to a good father
A great dad, but a bad husband

We brought out the worst in each other
Someone had to make the sparring end
'Cause I loved you, but I hated that me
And I don't wanna see that side again
But I'm sorry, Kim
More than you could ever comprehend
Leaving you was fucking harder than
Sawing off a fucking body limb

Once upon a time we're all we had
Maybe that's what drew us
To each other, it was true love
Shit we never knew was possible
We might have loved each other too much
And maybe that's what made us do what
We did to each other, all the screw-ups
'Cause you always thought that you was
More in love with me, and I was thinking
I was more in love than you was

For all the times that we thought it worked
Till we saw how wrong we were
When the dust settles now and all the dirt
If I touch the rawest nerve
All I want is for us not to hurt

And it's been an exhaustive search to find the words
But I just heard ""Mockingbird""
And got the urge to jot some verses and thoughts
The purpose was not to stir up or open wounds
I've caused a few and so have you
Or argue whose fault it was partly yours

Partly mine, but really no one's
This is so tough, I'm getting choked up
Oh fuck it, we both suck
We broke up, got back together
We both thought we had forever
Not bad people, just bad together
We were so nuts, backstabbed each other
Another blow struck

But there's no duckin' this blow
'Cause it's over and it's closure
But I'm not so sure how to close this
I just don't know how some people can be so good
At one thing and so fucked at a whole 'nother
Shit, it's no wonder

How come, how come, you can be a lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband (Dad) (you said)
Forever be a hero in my eyes (I reply)
But there's always another side to a good father
A great dad, but a bad husband"
Eminem,Tragic Endings (feat. Skylar Grey),"I'm stumbling, I can't see straight
And it's my fault I got this way
I got my hands on something great
And found a way to mess it all up

I did my best, I tried to change
But it's just in my DNA
I got my hands on something great
And found a way to fuck it up again

Now I'm the one thing you couldn't hate more
But you're the one thing that I would die for

All my life I was told I was never nothing special
I don't need to be reminded of it every other second
'Specially when all my self-esteem's
Already shot to hell, I'm falling helplessly
I'm embarrased, I don't want no one else to see

'Cause I feel like I'm a piece of shit every time she yells at me
Selfishly addicted, definitely doesn't help that she
Makes me feel like I've died and gone to heaven
But makes life a living hell for me
She does that thing with her lip, now she's melting me

I'm putty in her palms, I'm wrapped around her finger
A yo-yo on a string, she lets me sit there and just dangle
Until something better comes along
And she'll just drop me like a hot potato
I look like I'm in pain, but I'm okay though

'Cause I know she loves me
My friends, what do they know?

It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there, but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings

I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
Drunk off tragic endings

In my moments of weakness
I openly admit the shit I wouldn't normally
I'm extremely self-conscious and enormously
Insecure and she uses it to torture when she torments me
It only turns to ammunition for her in this war, when she

Gets going she don't stop, when I'm up she's like a downer
When I found her it was love at first encounter
Plus, somehow she musta took the carton of eggs off the counter
Cracked them and placed all the shells on the ground for
Me to walk on when I'm around her

But there's just something about her
That makes me not able to function without her
How can I get out of it when I don't know how to?
I'm a doubter, I'm a pessimist, make a believer out of me
And show me the way now or stay the fuck out of my cloud of rain
'Cause I'm going straight down the drain, I'm drowning

It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there, but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings

I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
Drunk off tragic endings

Now I'm the one thing you couldn't hate more
But you're the one thing that I would die for

It took a while for me to get it, but I think I've figured it out
She don't want me, she just don't wanna see me with someone else
The idea of seeing me happy destroys her in itself
To see me falling to pieces brings her joy and brings her hell

But it annoys her to see me get this straight, then say ""screw her!""
I threw up on myself, I'm dumb sick, I'm addicted to her
She's tryna block the door, so here's how I do her
Since I'm manure, she's a sewer
And this time this piece of shit's running through her

I can see the light, now I'm running to it
What the fuck? Shoulda knew it
Who would think she'd actually have the balls to do it?
As soon as I hopped in it, she gassed the car with lighter fluid
She's standing there with a rag, 'bout to put the lighter to it
Lit the fucking thing on fire, then she threw it

It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there, but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings

I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
Drunk off tragic endings"
Eminem,Framed,"Feeling kinky
Lip syncing to Too $hort's ""Freaky Tales"" (Biatch)
Having creepy visions of whiskey drinking
Envisioning sneaking into where Christie Brinkley dwells
I know this is risky thinking but I wanna stick her like she decals

But when murdering females
Better pay attention to these details or you could be derailed
Better wear at least three layers of clothing or be in jail
If you get scratched because your DNA'll
Be all up under her fingernails

Man, he hears you, I don't think he cares
He gives a fuck, even his pinky swears
Three personalities burstin' out of me, please beware
Her TV blares, can't hear the creaking stairs
She's unaware in no underwear

She's completely bare
Turns around and screams, I remember distinctly
I said ""I'm here to do sink repairs.""
Chop her up, put her body parts
In front of Steven Avery's trailer and leave 'em there

But damnit, I was framed
I know what this looks like, officers
Please just give me one minute
I think I can explain
I ain't murdered nobody
I know these words are so nutty
But I'm just here to entertain

How come your shirt is so bloody?
There's a missing person, so what?
He's got nothin' to do with me
I'm almost certain I was framed

Woke up, it was dawn, musta knew somethin' was wrong
Think I'm becomin' a monster 'cause of the drugs that I'm on
Donald Duck's on as the Tonka Truck in the yard
But dog, how the fuck is Ivanka Trump in the trunk of my car?

Gotta get to the bottom of it to try to solve it
Must go above and beyond, 'cause it's incumbent upon
Me, 'cause I feel somewhat responsible for the dumb little blonde
Girl, that motherfuckin' baton twirler that got dumped in the pond

Second murder with no recollection of it
Collectin' newspaper articles, cuttin' up sections from it
Memory's too fucked to remember
Destructive temper cut my public defender's
Jugular then stuck him up in a blender

Another dismembered toddler
Discovered this winter probably
'Cause the disassembled body
Was covered up in the snow since the month of November oddly
I'm wanted for questioning
Them son of a bitches probably just wanna pin this on me

But hey man, I was framed
I know what this looks like, officers
Please just give me one minute
I think I can explain
I ain't murdered nobody
I know these words are so nutty
But I'm just here to entertain

How come your shirt is so bloody?
There's a missing person, so what?
He's got nothin' to do with me
I'm almost certain I was framed

Still on the loose, they
Spotted me inside McDonald's, Tuesday
In a Toronto Blue Jays cap, lookin' like your college roommate
With Rihanna, Lupe, Saddam Hussein, Bobby Boucher
Or was it Cool J? The cops is on a goose chase

Just escaped from the state pen
For rapin' eight women who hate men
Don't make it no weirder, I'm naked
When I break in your basement

Under your baby's play pen, I lay and wait adjacent
Facin' the door, remaining patient
While stayin' complacent blatant
Sexual implications are continuing to get thrown
Insinuations are placed in little riddles and poems
Left on your pillow in hopes, that when you get home
You'll get the hint, ho, I'm in your window

But it never occurred to me I could describe a murder scene
In a verse and be charged with first degree
'Cause it just happened to match up perfectly
With the massacre or the Burger King burglary
No, officer, you see

I was framed
I know what this looks like, officers
Please just give me one minute
I think I can explain
I ain't murdered nobody
I know these words are so nutty
But I'm just here to entertain

How come your shirt is so bloody?
There's a missing person, so what?
He's got nothin' to do with me
I'm almost certain I was framed"
Eminem,Nowhere Fast (feat. Kehlani),"Ashes blowing in the air
The world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin' back and we're never getting old
'Cause the skies are black, but our heart's made of gold
Fuck doin' what you're told
We're goin' nowhere fast

I feel sorry for this beat, sympathy pains for this track
This road is takin' me back down memory lane with this rap
I can still look out in this crowd, be wowed and be taken aback
I'm simply stating a fact, I had Wembley Stadium packed

But now we're on a path headed to nowhere and fast
Another terrorist attacks
Like a tariff, blows half of Madison Square up, alas
We perish in the blast
But that isn't scaring us, we pass nowhere we're fearless
'Cause we're just

Ashes blowing in the air
Our world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah
(We don't give a... no, no)
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin' back and we're never getting old
'Cause the skies are black
But our heart's made of gold (golden)
Fuck doin' what you're told (what we're told)
We're goin' nowhere fast

'Cause we're goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' nowhere
We're on the run of our lives
Goin' nowhere fast

Fuck doin' what you're told, act like a two-year old
Shit is soon to go kaboom and blow
Anyways; for MC's it's a funeral
When I'm devisin' this rhyme
'Cause I'm awake and you're mourning
That's why I rise and I shine
Like a new day has dawned on me

Gusto, guts, bravado
Nuts and plus I kick up dust and cuss a lot
I musta got you in somewhat of a debacle
'Cause some stuff that's awful
Really don't mean nothin' although
There's a lot of shit I said in jest that's tough to swallow

But if at times my heart it seems
Like it's in the wrong place
It's probably 'cause it's on my sleeve
Keanu Reeves speed of life, avoid or veer
Or just steer toward it, we're only lookin' forward
But where we're goin', we have no idea

Nowhere to go, but hysterical, it's gettin' warm in here
I set the world on fire, was born to be an arsonist
Just one spark and it's lit
But I'mma still get dark on this shit
Told you I'd leave my mark on this bitch-war machine

But you forced me in a corner
I'm sure to have somethin' for your rear
And in the course of the assault as torture gets more severe
Go to war with me, you'll end up blew to Timbuktu
I send at you a ten-ton nuke like Kim Jong-Un
And end up ruinin' your career

But when all is said and done
And at the end of my run I'll just rewind clocks, forever young
Make time stop, will I ever fall off? That day will never come
Till the pine box, bitch, fuck you! I'm better than I ever was
Till the bomb drops, hope it never does
But I'm not gonna sweat it 'cause
This world's screwed, it's already fucked
And I'm on top, so everyone's just

Ashes blowing in the air (so we're...)
Our world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah
(We don't give a... no, no)
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin' back and we're never getting old
'Cause the skies are black
But our heart's made of gold (golden)
Fuck doin' what you're told (what we're told)
We're goin' nowhere fast

'Cause we're goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' nowhere
We're on the run of our lives
Goin' nowhere fast

You can't tell us nothin'
Hard-headed and we're stubborn
So, one ear and out the other when we're young, we're young
(We're on the run of our lives)
Who knows what the future for us could hold
Another shooter? Uh oh
(We're on the run of our lives)
No more tomorrows, we're done
And all we are is-

Ashes blowing in the air (so we're...)
Our world's on fire, but we don't care (don't care, yeah)
(We don't give a... no, no)
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin' back and we're never getting old
'Cause the skies are black
But our heart's made of gold (golden)
Fuck doin' what you're told (what we're told)
We're goin' nowhere fast

Goin' nowhere fast"
Eminem,Heat,"Wanna take it from the top?

Lady, you remind me of my raps on that Relapse shit
'Cause you got an ass thick as them accents
Two asscheek implants, call that an asset
'Cause you could set a glass on it, it's massive

From the first time I saw you, I actually said to myself
""I gotta meet her"" like a taxi
Exactly, love affair in the backseat
Sorry if I'm being graphic

But I'm stiff as a statue, you sat on a shelf
I feel like I'mma bust, maybe I'm just ahead of myself
Let me slow down, slow your Camaro
I'm tryna catch up, I'm tryna jump your bones to the marrow

Got me under your control and your spell
Wanna wrap you up, put you in a bow like an arrow
Grab you by the (meow), hope it's not a problem, in fact
About the only thing I agree on with Donald is that

So when I put this palm on your cat
Don't snap, it's supposed to get grabbed
Why do you think they call it a snatch?

I just wanna climb in the sack
I'ma keep it a hundred like my speedometer's at
I'm watchin' you rap, I'm the dude followin' back
About six cars, I'm in the 'lac, and I want to (ah)

All day, all day, all night
You ask, I stay the night
With you, you say you're fire
Me too, you're burning up, I'm running

All day, all night
You feel, my heat (fire)
Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel
My heat

Hate to inconvenience you at the convenience store
But them jeans you wore, like I've never seen before
I pretend I work there while I clean the floor
Checkin' you out, like the clerk while he rings you up
Pull up behind you when you're leavin'
And you don't even know it (ayo Rick, man)

She's brushin' her hair, adjustin' her mirror
She's rappin' my shit, but she wasn't aware
I was there, or maybe she was and just didn't care
Who knows? At least that ain't up in the air

It's somethin' to see
So like a chick who thinks her coochie don't stink
If she ain't plannin' to do shit this summer's eve
Maybe she wants to keep me company
But fuck the Pepé Le Pew shit

""Ain't steppin' to you, bitch,"" I say to myself
Plus she's bumpin' my music, ain't chasin' no tail
Like a skunk in heat, I could sweat her to some degree
But fuck it, I'm the male, let her come to me
(Could you repeat that again?)
Let her come to me

Male sweater, heat, some degree, fail
Fuck it, pull up beside her
Sideswipe her, Dodge Vipe-her, with a so bright a
Ass that she wants a computer lodged in her vagina
Said my dick is an apple, she said put it inside her
I said

All day, all day, all night
You ask, I stay the night
With you, you say you're fire
Me too, you're burning up, I'm running

All day, all night
You feel, my heat (fire)
Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel
My heat

Black out, come to, hands covered in blood
Motherfuckin' gloves and a shovel stuck in the mud
I just bodied the beat, so that ho musta been dug
'Cause it just died like food coloring (duh)

So let's get turnt like a shish kabab
Twist it, ma, like an air-conditioning knob
We'd be great together, don't care if it takes forever
If I gotta wait, I guess it's better late than never

You felt my heat rubbin' off on ya
I love your personality, come on, little mama
You're hot enough to melt Rick's beat, come jump in the water
I bet you get your self-esteem from your persona

With an ass to match, girl, your body is lit
You're striking, I'm a gas, girl, you're
Just gonna have to put them other chumps on the back burner
You got buns, I got Asperger's

Just let me rest my head between that set of D's
While I shred MC's like cheddar cheese
That's just the thoroughbred in me, ain't a better breed
My dog thinks so too, look at my pedigree

Ma, the world is what I think of you
I think you're divine, so I might swing on you
I'm just kiddin', girl, I wouldn't lift a finger or two
Unless it's the middle one to finger you

All day, all day, all night
You ask, I stay the night
With you, you say you're fire
Me too, you're burning up, I'm running

Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel
My heat

On the ones and twos, to three or four in the mornin'
Rick's on the cut like Neosporin (what?)
He's mixin' it up for me and Lauren
A teddy like short for Theodore
We're outtie, five thousand
Who the fuck? It's my big dick
So everybody get ready right fucking now!"
Eminem,Offended,"You claim if you get knocked by the cops
You'll give 'em not even a statement
Walk in the arraignment
Shoot the bailiff, karate kick the plaintiff

Gotti with the stainless
I'll just call it shoddy entertainment
If y'all was in the party gettin' faded
On molly, had the audience sedated

You wouldn't catch a body if it fainted
Probably let it fall and hit the pavement
But you'd be the first lobbyin' to claim it
Bitch, stop bein' a lame

Your hobby isn't robbery and dismemberin' body limbs
Like you was Tommy Lynn Sells
And chainsawin' them in the basement
Hardly fits your job description
Ain't nobody dippin' out the back of the club
Like, ""Oh my God, he's trippin'!""
Only time you get the blade is probably with the dang lawn equipment, ain't it?
Wouldn't take a bobby pin and wave it

I need to stop bein' debated
You're still copyin', Xeroxing, I'm still copping a feel
Like Bill Cosby at will, popping a pill
Then spill Oxys in Jill's coffee
Then send her out to the hotel lobby a lil' wobbly and still groggy

This blonde fuck's reprehensible
Misconducts, never sensible
Kiss my butt, my set of principles
Is gone, but till I get the President to respond
My pen and pencil is a missile launcher
And send it to Mitch McConnell
Just as big of a bitch as Donald-shit's on, bruh

Let me sing this shit soprano
While I do it pizzicato
Ivanka, stiff arm her while I'm hittin' on Melania
And this song's for all ya

'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms
(I hope you offended)
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words
(I hope you offended)
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse
(I hope you offended)
'Cause I swear when I get up, I'm never gonna let up
Till everybody eats my turds

These drums and hard snares bring out the worst in me
Like Justin Ross Harris at a nursery
Goin' ham at candy yam on nanny cam
I'm gettin' handys with the zanny Xannys in the Caddy armrest
I'm imagining objects, so I'm batting cobwebs
From a daddy longleg

And Hamtramck, got the panoramic camera
Xanax, a banana hammock and a Santa hat
I'm smellin' like a damn mechanic
With a chick that looks like Janet Jackson with a Spanish accent
Twice your age and I'm actin' half it

Grow up? Nah, not that I know of, y'all
Basement just got a frickin' overhaul
Got a stripper pole installed
Started rollin' all through those Kolonopins like a bowlin' ball
Like an overdose on twice the ratio of Propofol
And go through no withdrawal
While I get fellatio and give a facial to
An interracial blow-up doll of Rachel Dolezal

You're so appalled (""Em...""), so's my manager
Bitch, I'm amateur, fuck a pro career
Coast is clear, but nowhere to go from here
And nobody's close, so don't compare
They ain't nowhere near, I'm way over here
My competition can't see me
'Cause I don't own a mirror

But Marshall, you are terrific, so smart and gifted
I'm so narcissistic, when I fart I sniff it
Do a fake dab to smell my armpits with it
Your anxiety's throwin' gang signs
But I made strides with these rape lines
I'm cuttin' back on women hate crimes
Like Ray Rice when he FaceTimes

Bang, bang, bang, bang time
Dang knives'll butcher them gay wives
You're gonna need sutures the same size
As the blade I push into caput'cha
When I pull 'em like

Sleigh rides
Gotta stab a bitch at least eight times to make it on Dateline
I came to stake my claim like a canine waitin' in a buffet line
So, Kellyanne Conway, I'm a really bad hombre
Come play, belly dance on me
I've been making wedding plans all day

'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms
(I hope you offended)
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words
(I hope you offended)
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse
(I hope you offended)
'Cause I swear when I get up, I'm never gonna let up
Till everybody eats my turds

Eight year old with the wordplay
Girl, take this pole like a survey
Today wasn't my birthday
But I'm caked up like a dessert tray
So we're in shape, 'cause you're in a slurrin' state
I'm a ten, you're an eight
Like what I do before, after and during rape

You wanna get into a pissin' contest and find out who's better?
And they made a fool out of what I pulled out him
R. Kelly with a full bladder
Non-high school grad, I'm not a scholar
But I'm so cold when I'm droppin' knowledge
My degrees is the same as I got in college (zero)
But nobody's hotter, you owe me my respect

I owe you nada like lodi partner that blow me
Told you I'm so dirty, homie, you can throw me in some holy water
With some floaties on and get the soap
And try to get the Pope to hold me while you hose me off
And nope, I won't be washed
You hope to God I don't explode
I gotta blow this spot up though, I got a lotta mo'
I won't put the sugar coating on it though

'Cause sometimes you can feel like your energy's expired
Rap's got you drained, dead tired, zapped
You feel like a wet pile of crap
But look, man, like the feds buggin' my phone
Uh huh, I get why you're tapped
But you gotta get your fire back
Catch fire, get upset and fire back

Is what I tell myself when times get bad
'Cause sometimes I might get sad
Well, I take the same advice I had
And tell myself like I used to tell Hailie when life's a drag
Told her to do like her dad: don't cry, get mad
'Cause little baby powders belong in diaper bags
I'm hyper, by the time you see this side of me
I'm right in your ass (sodomy)

'Fore the pen, I stood up for the kid
Who had to put up with the bullies at his school (at his school)
You ain't have to have no money
Or go shoppin' just to cop a fuckin' attitude
Now my dough's amountin' to a mountain
It's rised too high to count it
Never asked to be rich, all I did was wish
I had a dime for every time that I was doubted

But then I think about it then I'm enraged
'Cause I just figured out that if I was paid
For the time I spent to put the pen to the page
It'd be minimum wage

But it's embedded in my head
I never hunted for the bread and butter
What I wanted was to be the one that they was scared of but
I'm never gonna get the credit for the sweat and blood
I put up in the pen, and when I'm dead I wonder
Will they put me on a pedestal
Or forget I was ever this incredible
I guess I better go harder than ever
'Cause I'll never get another motherfuckin' opportunity again
To offend as many people with this I can, simply because I can

'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms
(I hope you offended)
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words
(I hope you offended)
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse
(I hope you offended)
'Cause I swear when I get up, I'm never gonna let up
Till everybody eats my turds"
Eminem,Need Me (feat. Pink),"You're drunk, the carpet is burned
I hate to find you like this
I always find you like this
I come home and clean up your mess
What would you do without that?
Why do I always come back?
Oh, what I wouldn't do for you

And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me

Some nights I want to run for the hills
It's never easy with you
I cannot reason with you
But your smile is as rare as it comes
What would I do without that?
Maybe that's why I come back
Oh, what I wouldn't do for you

And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me

Startin' to think we were made for each other
But one of us in this relationship is raisin' the other
You remind me of my mother
We drive one another crazy as each other
And we're both adults so there's no excuse
For the games that we play with each other
Where you at? At a friend's? No, you ain't, motherfucker

But I give her the benefit of the doubt
Whenever the doubt kicks in, shiver when I touch her
'Cause I love her so much, I'm a sucker
Our bottom lip can quiver when she's in trouble
She's in hot water, think I caught her cheatin' again
Give her another chance? Another one after that?
I'm swimmin' in that Egyptian river, 'cause I'm in denial
Say I don't eat shit, but I got a shit-eatin' grin when I smile
Makin' an excuse for us to act it out
She's just actin' out, with her inner child

Then I set the truth on fire
'Cause I'd rather believe a lie
Than to breathe a sigh of relieve I don't believe in
Going to bed mad, I keep on tryin'
To make a bad girl good
But haven't I stood by you in good times?
And bad? I'm startin' to feel like your goddamn dad
'Cause I literally feel like you could die of a ""should I
Leave you for good?""-so never would I
It'd be all bad, never understood why they call it goodbye
But I think I'm a pretty damn good guy
And you're a good person too
I can save you, I can make you change
But I keep puttin' my fuckin' foot in my mouth

Every time I gotta come and bail you out
When you get in trouble that you get yourself in
And I'm in trouble but I can't leave, I'll sell you out
I could never turn my fuckin' back on you, what is that?
I'm co-dependent, I'm just now noticin' it
But somehow it's like every time I'm about to go to end it

I ain't got the cojones to do it, nor the heart
Our apartment's tore apart
You're usin' my heart for a dartboard
But God must've aligned stars for us
'Cause somebody paired us up
And they say He ain't capable of makin' a mistake
But this one's perfect

'Cause I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me"

Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh

I'm packin' up my shit, as much shit in the car as I can fit
And I'm just drivin' as far as I can get
Away from these problems till all of my sorrows I forget
What's tomorrow like? 'Cause tonight I'm startin' life again

Get to the corner and stop, fuck am I goin'?
Besides psycho when I fantasize startin' my whole life over
Yeah right, oh and I might go and
Get hypnotized so I don't even recognize no one

I try to look alive because there's nothin' like holdin'
Your head up high when you're dead inside and I just hide, so in
Case you're wonderin' why my inside's showin'
'Cause I done spilled all my guts and those are mine so I'm

Pickin' 'em up and stuffin' 'em back
Fuck it, I've done enough in this rap shit
Recovery brought me nothin' but back
To where I was and perhaps
This coulda been my victory lap if I wasn't on the verge of Relapse

What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh

It seems to be the reoccurring main thing
The shit I would daydream as a kid, I was eighteen
I went from an irate teenager to still raging
Isn't it though amazing, back then I put anything

Into the rhyme, whether it was sad, mad, happy or angry
I spit it, the mainstream, I hit it
Yay me, I did it! Did what?
Hailie, baby, I didn't mean to make you eighty

Percent of what I rapped about
Maybe I shoulda did a better job at separating
Shady and entertaining from real life
But this dang thing is still the hardest thing to explain

It's the craziest shit I
Ever seen, and back then it was like I ain't even
Bothered taking into consideration
You one day being older and may hear me say things
I did it, pay me, and be, it just ain't me

Okay, so ladies and gentlemen let's strip away everything
And see the main reason that I feel like a lame piece of shit
Or should I sound cranky and bitter
Complain, beef and bicker 'bout the same things

'Cause when I look at me, I don't see what they see
I feel ashamed, greedy
And lately I've been contemplating
Escaping to get away and go wherever this road takes me
It's making me crazy what's in my

What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh"
Eminem,Castle,"I built this castle
Now we are trapped on the throne
I'm sorry we're alone
I wrote my chapter
You'll turn the page when I'm gone
I hope you'll sing along
This is your song

I just want you to know that I ain't scared
Whatever it takes to raise you, I'm prepared
To do whatever, to do whatever
December 1st, 1995, dear Hailie
This is your song

You'll be coming out of Mommy's stomach soon
I better do something quick if I'mma be able to support you
I can barely support me, but as long as you're healthy
That's all that matters for the time being
But obviously assuming you will be

Just thinking ahead, I'ma make it if it kills me
Let's see how far I can take it with this music
I'm getting sick of chasing this illusion
Sorry for sloppy writing
The pen in my hand is shaking, please excuse me

Dad's a little nervous, but at the same time excited
If I use this same energy while I'm saying rhymes and write 'em
With the same passion and the same exact enthusiasm
As I'm using in this letter, maybe they can feel me as I'm

Trying to build these castles out of sand, baby girl
For you to sit on the throne, I got plans, baby girl
Welcome to Mom and Dad's crazy world
Love, Daddy, maple-flavored kisses, buttered pancakes and syrup

I built this castle
Now we are trapped on the throne
I'm sorry we're alone
I wrote my chapter
You'll turn the page when I'm gone
I hope you'll sing along
This is your song

I just want you to know that I ain't scared
Whatever it takes to raise you, I'm prepared
To do whatever, to do whatever
December 1st, 1996, dear Hailie

You got your mama's personality, same eyes as I got
Her beautiful smile, but your ears are the same size as mine are
Sorry for that, a little minor mishap
But you'll grow into 'em, baby, I'm on the grind now

I'm doing little shows, open mics, all-nighters at studios
While I'm tryna keep the lights on
Why does it seem like I'm so close to this dream, yet so far?
I just keep steering, I'mma turn into someone

I haven't the slightest clue what I'mma do if it falls through
You took your first steps today, you'll probably walk soon
My Infinite CD flopped, too many soft tunes
They're talking bad about Dad, it's ticking me off too

Makes me feel like I don't belong or something, ooh
I think I might have just stumbled onto something new
Got a prediction for the future, I'm hoping that you
Open this envelope when you're older and it holds true

I built this castle
Now we are trapped on the throne
I'm sorry we're alone
I wrote my chapter
You'll turn the page when I'm gone
I hope you'll sing along

December 24th, 2007, dear Hailie

Now if you found these letters, I guess I better try to explain
A lot's happened in between them since I rised to this fame
I've said your name but always tried to hide your face
This game is crazy, I wanted to claim my love for you, but dang

I never knew it'd be like this, if I did I wouldn't have done it
You ain't asked for none of this shit, now you're being punished?!
Things that should've been private with me and your mother is public
I can't stomach, they can take this fame back, I don't want it

I'll put out this last album then I'm done with it
One-hundred percent finished
Fed up with it, I'm hanging it up, fuck it
Excuse the cursing, baby, but just know
That I'm a good person, though they portray me as cold

And if things should worsen, don't take this letter I wrote
As a goodbye note, 'cause your dad's at the end of his rope
I'm sliding down a slippery slope
Anyways sweetie, I better go
I'm getting sleepy, love, Dad... shit, I don't know"
Eminem,Arose,"If I could rewind time like a tape
Inside a boombox, one day for every pill or Percocet that I ate
Cut down on the Valium, I'da heard everything
But death is turning so definite-wait

They got me all hooked up to some machine
I love you, being, didn't want you to know I was struggling
Feels like I'm underwater submerged like a submarine
Just heard that nurse say my liver and kidneys aren't functioning

Been flirtatious with death, skirt-chasing, I guess
It's arrivederci, same nurse, just heard say they're unplugging me
And it's your birthday, Jade, I'm missing your birthday
Baby girl, I'm sorry, I fucking hate when you hurt, Hai

And sweeties, thank you for waiting to open gifts
But, girls, you can just open 'em
Dad ain't making it home for Christmas
Wish I had the strength to just blow a kiss
I go to make a fist, but I can't make one, I'm frozen stiff

I yell, but nothing comes out, I'm crying inside, I shout
My vocal cords won't permit me, I scream, but it's not aloud
You put your arm around Mama to calm her, wow
I just thought about the aisle, I'll never get to walk us down

Never see you graduate in your caps and gowns
It's 'bout to be 2008, how's this happening now?
I've got so much more to do
And, Proof, I'm truly sorry if I let you down, but this tore me in two

The thought of no more me and you
You gave me shoes, Nikes like new for me for school
Doody, I'm trying, but you, you were the glue that binded
So many things-time, I'd give anything to rewind it

I had to walk down my halls and constantly be reminded
By pictures all on my walls and I couldn't sleep at night 'cause
That image burned in my brain of you on that table
Me falling across your body, not able to stand to save you

God, why did you take him?
I'm tryna keep his legacy alive, but I'm dying, where's Nathan?
Little ladies, be brave, take care of your mother
Smile pretty for pictures, always cherish each other

I'll always love ya and I'll be in the back of your memory
And I know you'll never forget me
Just don't get sad when remembering
And, little bro, keep making me proud
You better marry that girl 'cause she's faithfully down

And when you're exchanging those sacred vows
Just know that if I could be there, I would
And should you ever see parenthood, I know you'll be good at it
Oh, almost forgot to do something, thank my father too
I actually learned a lot from you
You taught me what not to do

And, Mom, wish I'd have had the chance
To have one last heart-to-heart honest and open talk with you
Doody, I see you, I go to walk to you
And I can feel my soul leave my body and float across the room

Nurses lean over the bed, pulling tubes out
Then the sheet over my head, shut the room down
Girls, please don't get upset
I see them cheeks soaking and wet
As you squeeze hold of my neck, so forcibly, don't wanna let

Me go, pillow drenched, emotional wrecks
With every second, each closer to death
But suddenly I feel my heart begin to beat slow
Then a breath, machines go
Must've guessed the cheat codes to this shit

I'm tryna rewind time like a tape
Find an escape, make a beeline, try and awake
From this dream, I need to re-find my inner strength
To remind me, even if a steep climb I must take
To rewrite a mistake, I'm rewinding the tape

Part II: Castle Extended

(I don't want it)
I'll put out this last album, then I'm done with it
One hundred percent finished, fed up with it
I'm hanging it up, fuck it!
Excuse the cursing, baby, but just know
That I'm a good person, though they portray me as cold

And if things should worsen, but I bet you they won't
I'm pledging to throw this methadone in the toilet
Shred these old letters I wrote
All that old pathetic loathing, closing credits can roll
I'm proud to be back

I'm 'bout to, like a rematch, outdo Relapse
With Recovery, Mathers LP2
Help propel me to victory laps
Gas toward 'em and fast forward the past
Consider the last four minutes as

The song I'da sang to my daughters
If I'da made it to the hospital less than two hours later, but I fought it
And came back like a boomerang on 'em
Now a new day is dawnin'
I'm up, Tuesday, it's mornin'-now I know"
Eminem,River (feat. Ed Sheeran),"I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water
Feel it washing over me

Oh, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth in my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

He's coming home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatch
On his breath's Jack is a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back

It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet pack
She's kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be moving on to the next?
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks

'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan
To stab him in the back, knife in hand
Says the relationship's hanging by a strand

So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, despite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him
I don't care, hi Susanne, but I shoulda said ""Bye Susanne""
After the first night, but tonight I am

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water
Feel it washing over me

Oh, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth in my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

One-night stand, turned into night staying
He was calling so might scram, now we hug tight and
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too

Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, ensued
And witnessed you hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you

So I revert to the studio like hole in the wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew

And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage of my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burning the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
Fuck

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water
Feel it washing over me

Oh, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth in my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

My name's (oh), my name's (oh)
Denver (oh), river run
Call me (oh), call me (oh)
River (oh), we'll let the river run

Always the bridesmaid, never the bride, hey
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
The seat was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm sliding on ice, maybe

That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
What I made you terminate, my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled

What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie to tell an unborn child?

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water
Feel it washing over me

Oh, little one (I'm sorry)
I don't want to admit to something (I fucked up)
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth in my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run"

I'm young and I love to be young
I'm free and I love to be free
To live my life the way I want
To say and do whatever I please"
Taylor Swift,...Ready For It?,"Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wonder how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom

Some, some boys are tryin' too hard
He don't try at all, though
Younger than my exes but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta

I-I-I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby, mmm
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you
So I take my time
Are you ready for it?

Me, I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never saying sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist
And we'll move to an island-and

And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
Every lover known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now

I-I-I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know (no one has to know)

In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby, mmm
In the middle of the night in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you

Are you ready for it?
Oh, are you ready for it?

Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin

I-I-I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby, mmm
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you
So I take my time
In the middle of the night

Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin

Are you ready for it?

Taylor Swift,End Game,"I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team (oh oh oh)
I wanna be your end game, end game

Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations
Ah, and you heard about me
Ooh, I got some big enemies (yeah)

Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation (git git)
Ah, and I heard about you (yah)
Ooh, you like the bad ones too

You so dope, don't overdose, I'm so stoked, I need a toast
We do the most, I'm in the Ghost like I'm whippin' a boat
I got a reputation, girl, that don't precede me (yah)
I'm a call away whenever you need me (yeah)

I'm in a G5 (yah), come to the A-Side (yah)
I got a bad boy persona, that's what they like (what they like)
You love it, I love it too, 'cause you my type (you my type)
You hold me down and I protect you with my life

I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex-love you don't wanna see
I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)
Like the other girls do

I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Drinking on a beach with you all over me
I know what they all say (I know what they all say)
But I ain't tryna play

I wanna be your end game (end game)
I wanna be your first string (first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your endgame, endgame

Now well, when I was young, we connected when we were little bit older
Both sprung, I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders
Reputation precedes me and rumors are knee-deep
The truth is, it's easier to ignore it, believe me

Even when we'd argue, we'd not do it for long
And you understand the good and bad end up in the song
For all your beautiful traits and the way you do it with ease
For all my flaws, paranoia and insecurities

I've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny
After the storm, something was born on the 4th of July
I've passed days without fun, this endgame is the one
With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say it

I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex-love you don't wanna see
I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)
Like the other girls do

I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Drinking on a beach with you all over me
I know what they all say, yeah
But I ain't tryna play

I wanna be your end game (end game)
I wanna be your first string (wanna be your first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations
Ah, and you heard about me
Ooh, I got some big enemies

Hey, big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation
Ah, and I heard about you
Ooh, you like the bad ones, too

I hit you like bang, we tried to forget it, but we just couldn't
And I bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put 'em
Reputation precedes me, they told you I'm crazy
I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me

And I can't let you go, your handprints on my soul
It's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold
You been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks
So here's the truth from my red lips

I wanna be your end game (end game)
I wanna be your first string (me and you, first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (be your A-Team now, A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

I wanna be your end game (oh, I do)
I wanna be your first string (first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game"
Taylor Swift,I Did Something Bad,"I never trust a narcissist, but they love me
So I play 'em like a violin
And I make it look oh so easy
'Cause for every lie I tell them, they tell me three
This is how the world works
Now all he thinks about is me

I can feel the flames on my skin
Crimson red paint on my lips
If a man talks shit, then I owe him nothing
I don't regret it one bit, 'cause he had it coming

They say I did something bad
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

I never trust a playboy, but they love me
So I fly 'em all around the world
And I let them think they saved me
They never see it comin', what I do next
This is how the world works
You gotta leave before you get left

I can feel the flames on my skin
He says, ""Don't throw away a good thing""
But if he drops my name, then I owe him nothin'
And if he spends my change, then he had it comin'

They say I did something bad
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

It just felt so good

They're burning all the witches, even if you aren't one
They got their pitchforks and proof, their receipts and reasons
They're burning all the witches, even if you aren't one

So light me up (light me up), light me up (light me up)
Light me up, go ahead and light me up (light me up)
Light me up (light me up), light me up (light me up)
Light me up (light me up), light me up

You ask me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast (what?)

The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours

Taylor Swift,So It Goes...,"See you in the dark
All eyes on you, my magician
All eyes on us
You make everyone disappear, and

Cut me into pieces
Gold cage, hostage to my feelings
Back against the wall
Trippin', trip-trippin' when you're gone

'Cause we break down a little
But when you get me alone, it's so simple
'Cause baby, I know what you know
We can feel it

And all our pieces fall
Right into place
Get caught up in a moment
Lipstick on your face
(So it goes...)

I'm yours to keep
And I'm yours to lose
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
Do bad things with you
(So it goes...)

Met you in a bar
All eyes on me, your illusionist
All eyes on us
I make all your grey days clear

And wear you like a necklace
I'm so chill, but you make me jealous
But I got your heart
Skippin', skip-skippin' when I'm gone

'Cause we break down a little
But when I get you alone, it's so simple
'Cause baby, I know what you know
We can feel it

And all our pieces fall
Right into place
Get caught up in a moment
Lipstick on your face
(So it goes...)

I'm yours to keep
And I'm yours to lose
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
Do bad things with you
(So it goes...)

Come here, dressed in black now
So, so, so it goes
Scratches down your back now
So, so, so it goes

You did a number on me
But, honestly, baby, who's counting?
I did a number on you
But, honestly, baby, who's counting?

You did a number on me
But, honestly, baby, who's counting?
Who's counting?

Taylor Swift,Gorgeous,"Gorgeous

You should take it as a compliment
That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
You should think about the consequence
Of your magnetic field being a little too strong

And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us
He's in the club doing, I don't know what
You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much
(I hate you so much)

Whisky on ice, Sunset and Vine
You've ruined my life by not being mine

You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face

And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?

You should take it as a compliment
That I'm talking to everyone here but you
And you should think about the consequence
Of you touching my hand in the darkened room (dark room, dark room)

If you've got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her
But if you're single that's honestly worse
'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts

I feel like I might sink and drown and die

Taylor Swift,Getaway Car,"(No, nothing good starts in a getaway car)

It was the best of times, the worst of crimes
I struck a match and blew your mind
But I didn't mean it
And you didn't see it

The ties were black, the lies were white
In shades of gray in candlelight
I wanted to leave him
I needed a reason

X marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, I was lyin' to myself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned we were cursed
We never had a shot, gunshot in the dark (oh)

You were drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin', but we never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me

I shoulda known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me

In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ah
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

It was the great escape, the prison break
The light of freedom on my face
But you weren't thinkin'
And I was just drinkin'

Well, he was runnin' after us, I was screamin', ""go, go, go""
But with three of us, honey, it's a sideshow
And a circus ain't a love story
And now we're both sorry (we're both sorry)

Put the money in a bag and I stole the keys

People started talking, putting us through our paces
I knew there was no one in the world who could take it

Deep fears that the world would divide us

All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from all this (ah, ha, ha, ha)

Say my name and everything just stops

Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, o-o-off

Carve your name into my bedpost

Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, o-o-off

Inescapable, I'm not even gonna try
And if I get burned, at least we were electrified
I'm spilling wine in the bathtub

Flashback to my mistakes
My rebounds, my earthquakes

'Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off, take it off
(Ha, ha ha)

There is an indentation
In the shape of you
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
You made your mark on me, golden tattoo
Only bought this dress so you could take it off"
Taylor Swift,Call It What You Want,"My castle crumbled overnight
I brought a knife to a gun fight
They took the crown but it's alright

All the liars are calling me one
Nobody's heard from me for months
I'm doing better than I ever was

'Cause my baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to

My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
So, call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to

All my flowers grew back as thorns
Windows boarded up after the storm
He built a fire just to keep me warm

All the drama queens taking swings
All the jokers dressing up as kings
They fade to nothing when I look at him

And I know I make the same mistakes every time
Bridges burn, I never learn
At least I did one thing right
I did one thing right

I'm laughing with my lover
Making forts under covers
Trust him like a brother, yeah, you know I did one thing right
Starry eyes sparking up my darkest night

My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to

My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
(Call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to)
So, call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to

I want to wear his initial
On a chain round my neck, chain round my neck
Not because he owns me
But 'cause he really knows me
(Which is more than they can say)

I recall late November
Holding my breath, slowly I said,
""You don't need to save me,
But would you run away with me?""
Yes

My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
(Call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to)
So, call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to

My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
(Call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to)
So, call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to

(Call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to)
(So, call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want)
(Call it what you want to)

Call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want

Dime si es verdad
Me dijeron que te estas casando
Tú no sabes como estoy sufriendo
Esto te lo tengo que decir

Cuéntame
Tu despedida para mi fue dura
Será que él te llevo a la luna
Y yo no supe hacerlo así

Te estaba buscando
Por las calles gritando
Eso me está matando oh no

Te estaba buscando
Por las calles gritando
Como un loco tomando oh...

Es que yo sin ti
Y tú sin mi
Dime quién puede ser feliz
Esto no me gusta
Esto no me gusta

Es que yo sin ti
Y tú sin mi
Dime quién puede ser feliz
Eso no me gusta
Eso no me gusta

Vivir si ti, no aguanto más
Por eso vengo a decirte lo que siento
Estoy sufriendo en esta soledad

Y aunque tu padre no aprobó esta relación
Yo sigo insistiendo a pedir perdón
Lo único que importa está en tu corazón

Te estaba buscando
Por las calles gritando
Esto me está matando oh no

Te estaba buscando
Por las calles gritando
Como un loco tomando oh...

Es que yo sin ti
Y tú sin mi
Dime quién puede ser feliz
Esto no me gusta
Esto no me gusta

Es que yo sin ti
Y tú sin mi
Dime quién puede ser feliz
Eso no me gusta
Eso no me gusta

Yo te juré a ti eterno amor
Y ahora otro te da calor
Cuando en las noches tienes frío oh oh

Yo sé que él te parece mejor
Pero yo estoy en tu corazón
Y por eso pido perdón

Es que yo sin ti
Y tú sin mi
Dime quién puede ser feliz
Esto no me gusta oh no

Es que yo sin ti
Y tú sin mi
Dime quién puede ser feliz
Esto no me gusta oh yeah...

Dicen que uno no sabe lo que tiene
Hasta que lo pierde pero...

Y hacer el intento

Fall Out Boy,Centuries,"Some legends are told, some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me, remember me for centuries
And just one mistake is all it will take
We'll go down in history, remember me for centuries

Hey ya, oh hey
Hey ya, remember me for centuries

Mummified my teenage dreams
No, it's nothing wrong with me
The kids are all wrong, the story's all off
Heavy metal broke my heart
Come on, come on and let me in
Them bruises on your thighs like my fingerprints
And this is s'posed to match the darkness that you felt
I never meant for you to fix yourself

Some legends are told, some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me, remember me for centuries
And just one mistake is all it will take
We'll go down in history, remember me for centuries

Hey ya, oh hey
Hey ya, remember me for centuries

I can't stop 'til the whole world knows my name
'Cause I was only born inside my dreams
Until you die for me, as long as there's a light
My shadow's over you, 'cause I, I am the opposite of amnesia
And you're a cherry blossom, you're about to bloom
You look so pretty, but you're gone so soon

Some legends are told, some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me, remember me for centuries
And just one mistake is all it will take
We'll go down in history, remember me for centuries

Hey ya, oh hey
Hey ya, remember me for centuries

We've been here forever
And here's the frozen proof
I could scream forever
We are the poisoned youth

Some legends are told, some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me, remember me for centuries
And just one mistake is all it will take
We'll go down in history, remember me for centuries

Hey ya, oh hey
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries"

Oh, I see the truth in your lies
I see nobody by your side
But I'm with you when you're all alone

Guy Sebastian,Battle Scars,"Lupe Fiasco:
Hope the wound heals but it never does
That's 'cause you at war with love
You at war with love, yeah

Guy Sebastian:
These battle scars don't look like they're fading
Don't look like they're ever going away
They ain't never gonna change
These battle...

Lupe Fiasco:
Never let a wound ruin me
But I feel like ruins wooing me
Arrow holes that never close from cupid on a shooting spree
Feeling stupid 'cause I know it ain't no you and me

But when you're trying to beat the odds up
Been trying to keep your nods up and you know that you should know
And let her go but the fear of the unknown
Holding another lover strong sends you back into the zone

With no Tom Hanks to bring you home
A lover not a fighter on the frontline with a poem
Trying to write yourself a rifle, maybe sharpen up a song
To fight the tanks and drones of you being alone

Guy Sebastian:
I wish I never looked, I wish I never touched
I wish that I could stop loving you so much
'Cause I'm the only one that's trying to keep us together
When all of the signs say that I should forget her

I wish you weren't the best, the best I ever had
I wish that the good outweighed the bad
'Cause it'll never be over until you tell me it's over

These battle scars, don't look like they're fading
Don't look like they're ever going away
They ain't never gonna change

These battle scars, don't look like they're fading
Don't look like they're ever going away
They ain't never gonna change
These battle...

Lupe Fiasco:
(And just leave then)
You shouldn't have but you said it
(And I hope you never come back)
It shouldn't have happened but you let it
Now you're down on the ground screaming ""Medic!""
The only thing that comes is the post-traumatic stresses

Shields, body armors and vests
Don't properly work, that's why you're in a locker full of hurt
The enemy within and all the fires from your friends
The best medicine is to probably just let her win

Guy Sebastian:
I wish I couldn't feel, I wish I couldn't love
I wish that I could stop 'cause it hurts so much
And I'm the only one that's trying to keep us together
When all of the signs say that I should forget her

I wish you weren't the best, the best I ever had
I wish that the good outweighed the bad
'Cause it'll never be over until you tell me it's over

These battle scars, don't look like they're fading
Don't look like they're ever going away
They ain't never gonna change

These battle scars, don't look like they're fading
Don't look like they're ever going away
They ain't never gonna change
These battle...

'Cause you've set me on fire
I've never felt so alive, yeah

Lupe Fiasco:
Now hope wounds heal but it never does
That's because you at war with love

Guy Sebastian:
And I'm at the point of breaking
And it's impossible to shake it

Lupe Fiasco:
See, you hoped the wound heals but it never does
That's 'cause you at war with love
Hope it heals but it never does
That's 'cause you at war with love

Macklemore & Ryan Lewis,Growing Up (feat. Ed Sheeran),"They say boys don't cry
But your dad has shed a lot of tears
They say I should be a strong man
But baby, I'm still filled with fear
Sometimes I don't know who I am
Sometimes I question why I'm here
I just wanna be a good dad
Will I be? I have no idea
They say girls shouldn't be tough
And moms should raise their kids at home
But baby, I know that that isn't true
'Cause your momma's the toughest person I know
I wanna raise you to be like her
And watch you show the world how to do it on your own
I'm still tryna figure out who I am
I don't wanna mess this up or do this wrong
I'm gonna be there for your first breath
I don't know if I'll be there for your first step
I can promise you that I'll try to work less
But the tour's routed, and I got this album
Put in so many hours, and I just want the outcome
To be something that I can look back and I can be proud of
Don't wanna be a dad that's living in FaceTime
But I've got a world to sing to and you at the same time
I won't spoil you, you can trust that
For your sweet sixteen, you get a bus pass
Had your heart broken? Been there, done that
I love you and I can't give you enough of that
Get back to community that raised you up
Read Langston Hughes, I suggest ""A Raisin in the Sun""
Listen to Sam Cooke, a change gon' come
You put the work in, don't worry about the praise, my love
Don't try to change the world, find something that you love
And do it every day
Do that for the rest of your life
And eventually, the world will change

I'll be patient, one more month
You'll wrap your fingers 'round my thumb
Times are changing, I know, but who am I if
I'm the person you become
If I'm still growing up, up, up, up
If I'm still growing up, up, up, up
I'm still growing up

I recommend that you read ""The Alchemist""
Listen to your teachers, but cheat in calculus
Tell the truth, regardless of the consequence
And every day, give your momma a compliment
Take your girl to the prom
But don't get too drunk hanging out the limo
Slow dance with your woman in your arms
Sneak her in after but boy, you better tiptoe
Don't wake your mom up, do yoga, learn 'bout karma
Find God, but leave the dogma
The quickest way to happiness? Learning to be selfless
Ask more questions, talk about yourself less
Study David Bowie, James Baldwin and 2Pac
Watch the sun set with best friends from a rooftop
Wear a helmet, don't be stupid, jaywalk, but look before you do it
If it snows, go outside, build a jump, get some help
Get a sled, thrash the hill with your friends, till it melts
Go to festivals, camp, fall in love and dance
You're only young once, my loved one, this is your chance
Take risks, 'cause life moves so fast
You're only young once, my loved one, this is your chance

I'll be patient, one more month
You'll wrap your fingers round my thumb
Times are changing, I know, but who am I if
I'm the person you become
If I'm still growing up, up, up, up
I'm still growing up, up, up, up

I'll be patient, one more month
You'll wrap your fingers round my thumb
Times are changing, I know, but who am I if
I'm the person you become
If I'm still growing up, still growing up, still growing up
If I'm still growing up, still growing up, still growing up

I'm still growing up
I'm still growing up"

Eminem,Mockingbird,"Spoken
Yeah, I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey, what daddy always tell you?
Straighten up little soldier, stiffen up that upper lip
What you crying about?
You got me.

Hailie, I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone, but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry

'Cause you're scared, I ain't there? Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more crying, wipe them tears, daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Laney uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it

We're all we got in this world When it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, mama's always on the news

I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growing up his daddy, that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did

We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have gotten so bad between us I don't see us ever being together
Ever again like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason

I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream

Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night

I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise mama's gon' be alright

It's funny, I remember back one year, when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up, and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me, 'cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying

'Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time every house that we lived in either kept getting broke into and robbed
Or shot up on the block and your mom

Was saving money for you in a jar
Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad, it broke your mama's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart

Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so mama moved back
On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre and flew you and mama out to see me

But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
Then you started seeing daddy on the TV
And mama didn't like it and you and Laney were to young to understand it
Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand

'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house
Just reminiscing lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now

Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
Laney I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Shh, mama's only gone for the moment

Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night

I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise mama's gon' be alright

And if you ask me too, daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'mma give you the world
I'mma buy a diamond ring for you, I'mma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile

And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'mma break that birdies' neck

Adam Lambert,Better Than I Know Myself,"Cold as ice
And more bitter than a December

And I know that I
I sometimes tend to lose my temper
And I cross the line
Yeah that's the truth

I know it gets hard sometimes
But I could never
Leave your side
No matter what I say

'Cause if I wanted to go I would have gone by now,
But I really need you near me to
Keep my mind off the edge
If I wanted to leave I would have left by now,
But you're the only one that knows me
Better than I know myself

All along
I tried to pretend it didn't matter
If I was alone
But deep down I know
If you were gone
For even a day I wouldn't know which way to turn
'Cause I'm lost without you.

I know it gets hard sometimes
But I could never
Leave your side
No matter what I say

'Cause if I wanted to go I would have gone by now,
But I really need you near me to
Keep my mind off the edge
If I wanted to leave I would have left by now,
But you're the only one that knows me
Better than I know myself

I get kind of dark
Let it go too far
I can be obnoxious at times
But try and see my heart
'Cause I need you need now
So don't let me down
You're the only thing in this world I would die without

'Cause if I wanted to go I would have gone by now,
But I really need you near me to

Adam Lambert,Never Close Our Eyes,"I wish that this night would never be over
There's plenty of time to sleep when we die
So let's just stay awake until we grow older
If I had my way we'd never close our eyes, our eyes, never

I don't wanna let a minute get away
'Cause we got no time to lose
None of us are promised to see tomorrow
And what we do is ours to choose

Forget about the sunrise
Fight the sleep in your eyes
I don't wanna miss a second with you
Let's stay this way forever
It's only getting better if we want it to

You know I wish that this night would never be over

But what goes up must come down
Why can't we just live life with no consequence?
And always live in the now

'Cause I, I found love

So take my hand, and shed a tear
Before I'm gone, it's now or never

I saw you glow, and had to know
Where our journey would lead us
To the story's end, and back again

Owl City,Bird With A Broken Wing,"So I walk alone down the darkest roads
'Cause I've always known how the story goes
When the curtain falls I'll be wearing thin
Clawing at the walls as they're closing in
In this twisted plot I was destined for
I'm an astronaut on the ocean floor
So misunderstood till the bloody end
How I wish I could do it all again

It feels like I'm a lone survivor
Forgotten in a dark and deadly world
And on my own I walk alone
To see the sun again I'd give anything
But life demands a final chapter
A story that we all must leave behind
It's do or die, and this is mine
The anthem of a bird with a broken wing

It's another night of the living dead
Like a viper bite in a spiderweb
It's so deathly dark in the alleyway
And a bleeding heart makes you easy prey
I would run and hide for the afternoon
With the butterfly in the panic room
Though I won't be missed, I would say it's time
For a different twist in the story line

It feels like I'm a lone survivor
Forgotten in a dark and deadly world
And on my own I walk alone
To see the sun again I'd give anything
But life demands a final chapter
A story that we all must leave behind
It's do or die, and this is mine
The anthem of a bird with a broken wing

To free time and starry nights
To bonfires and fireflies

From walking over miles of concrete
And I can't wait to dream

A diner off the highway with a corner booth
And every gravel road is a trip down memory lane
And back home, where the corn grows ten feet tall
Every year's measured on the pantry wall
The willow trees are waving till we come back home again

And pick my heart up off the floor
You put my life back together

And rock and roll

And a heart of gold
And you could say he's a man
Of few words

And even though I'm a little taller
I still look up to him

And to fight, and to dream

That my Dad's a Hero to me

Rust-ridden fenders
And doors full of dings
Somehow he can fix about anything
I didn't think he knew how to cry
Till our dog died that year
He doesn't always say ""I love you""
But I can hear him loud and clear

He built me a house
In the arms of a tree
He taught me to drive
And to fight, and to dream

I won't say a word
They've all been said before, you know

Like we're not scared of what is coming next
Or scared of having nothing left

I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is

If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again?

I don't need your honesty
It's already in your eyes
And I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me
No one knows me like you do
And since you're the only one that matters
Tell me who do I run to?

Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow

If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend

Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again?

Let this be our lesson in love
Let this be the way we remember us
I don't wanna be cruel or vicious
And I ain't asking for forgiveness
All I ask is

Owl City,Fiji Water,"Got an email at 22
Told me I could be a star
On a plane for the first time
I couldn't wait to start
Landed at Jfk
Father Christmas picked me up
Checked in to a dream hotel and I thought
""There's no such thing as luck""
I walked in to my interview
And I thought ""There's no such thing as luck""

And oh, if I only knew then what I know now
I'd stand like a one-man band and I'd say
All this is new to me but
Here's how it's gonna be

And I'd say
""Hey, there is more to me than meets the eye
Let me be who I wanna be""
And I'd say
""Hey, I'm an oddity and that's all right
Let me fly and follow my dreams""
Then I'd say
""Hey thanks for the weekend
A good time was had by all""
And I'd say
""Hey thanks for the weekend
I ain't a smooth-talker but thanks for the Fiji water""

I had so much on my mind
Amazed by the bright lights
I stayed up half the night
And boy I took a leap of faith
With nowhere else to go but up
I walked in to my interview
And I thought
""There's no such thing as luck""

And oh, if I only knew then what I know now
I'd stand like a one man band and I'd say
All this is new to me, but here's how it's gonna be

And I'd say
""Hey, there is more to me than meets the eye
Let me be who I wanna be""
And I'd say
""Hey, I'm an oddity and that's alright
Let me fly and follow my dreams""
And I'd say
""Hey, thanks for the weekend
A good time was had by all""
And I'd say
""Hey, thanks for the weekend
I ain't a spin doctor but thanks for the offer
And by the way
Hey thanks for the weekend
You know I had a ball""
And I'd say
""Hey, thanks for the weekend
I ain't a smooth-talker but thanks for the Fiji Water""

Thanks for the Fiji Water

I laughed when I got back home and I thought
""There's no such thing as luck"""

Switch on the sky and the stars glow for you
Go see the world 'cause it's all so brand new
Don't close your eyes 'cause your future's ready to shine
It's just a matter of time before we learn how to fly
Welcome to the rhythm of the night
There's something in the air you can't deny

Owl City,The Saltwater Room,"I opened my eyes last night
And saw you in the low light
Walking down by the bay on the shore
Staring up at the stars that aren't there anymore

I was feeling the night grow old
And you were looking so cold
So like an introvert, I drew my over-shirt
Around my arms and began to shiver violently before

You happened to look and see
The tunnels all around me
Running into the dark underground
All the subways around create a great sound

To my motion fatigue, farewell
With your ear to a seashell
You can hear the waves in underwater caves
As if you actually were inside a saltwater room

Time together isn't ever quite enough
When you and I are alone, I've never felt so at home
What will it take to make or break this hint of love?
Only time, only time

Can you believe that the crew has gone
And they wouldn't let me sign on?
All my islands have sunk in the deep
And I can hardly relax or even oversleep

But I feel warm with your hand in mine
When we walk along the shoreline
I guess we'll never know why sparrows love the snow
We'll turn out all of the lights and set this ballroom aglow

(So tell me darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?)
(Yeah, all the time)
(All the time)

Time together isn't ever quite enough
When you and I are alone, I've never felt so at home
What will it take to make or break this hint of love?
Only time, only time

When we're apart whatever are you thinking of?
If this is what I call home, why does it feel so alone?
So tell me darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?
All the time, all the time

Time together isn't ever quite enough
When we're apart whatever are you thinking of?
What will it take to make or break this hint of love?
So tell me darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?
All the time, oh all the time"
Owl City,The 5th of July,"My mom woke my dad up
And said ""It's time to leave! ""
So they jumped into the old Caprice
And tore off into the night
On the 4th of July
They flew through the darkness
Driving like Jehu
And they rolled into Ottumwa
Before the sun began to rise
On the 4th of July
In walks Bob and Janice
Rachel's on her way
To peek in through the window
Hoping to hear her grandson cry
On the 4th of July

My mother watched the fireworks
From her hospital bed
And after it was all over
She held me for the first time
On the 5th of July
I've got my mother's brown eyes
And my dad's quiet way
And Grandma Rachel's love for music
The morning I arrived
On the 5th of July
Deep in Iowa country
In a Heavenly Hideaway
On the shores of Lake Rathbun
My folks brought me home
On the 5th of July

And that was when
Life began for me
And that was when
Life began for me

A teacher and a mechanic
Brought me into this world
They loved me with all their hearts
Since the day I opened my eyes
On the 5th of July

And that was when
Life began for me
And that was when
Life began for me"
Owl City,Vanilla Twilight,"The stars lean down to kiss you 
And I lie awake and miss you
Pour me a heavy dose of atmosphere

'Cause I'll doze off safe and soundly
But I'll miss your arms around me
I'd send a postcard to you dear
'Cause I wish you were here

I'll watch the night turn light blue
But it's not the same without you
Because it takes two to whisper quietly

The silence isn't so bad
Till I look at my hands and feel sad
'Cause the spaces between my fingers are right where yours fit perfectly

I'll find repose in new ways
Though I haven't slept in two days
'Cause cold nostalgia chills me to the bone

But drenched in vanilla twilight
I'll sit on the front porch all night
Waist deep in thought because when I think of you
I don't feel so alone

I don't feel so alone
I don't feel so alone
As many times as I blink I'll think of you tonight
I'll think of you tonight

When violet eyes get brighter
And heavy wings grow lighter
I'll taste the sky and feel alive again

Then I'll forget the world that I knew
But I swear I won't forget you
Oh, if my voice could reach back through the past
I'd whisper in your ear

Oh darling, I wish you were here"

And all it wants is to have somethin' to chew
Somethin' to chew (somethin' to chew)

Yeah, uh, and still conjoined at
The hip with hop, still on point and poignant
Skilled as Floyd is
In this field, and still no filter, boy
I'll put you in your place (yeah) like a realtor, boy
You still ain't in the building, boy

I will destroy shit, even as I build it
Get the drillbit, pen is filled with poison
Which is the source, easy to still pinpoint it
(Like what?) Like a real thin joint it
(What?) Comes on Quilted Northern
(And what?) In a built-in toilet
(Yeah) Bitch, I told you I'm a dog (woof)

I wouldn't heal with ointment
Way I'm kickin' these fairies tales
Should write a children's storybook (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Million voices in my head
But still get a little bit of thrill and some real enjoyment
(Off what?) Off the feel of going in
(Like?) Like your bitch when she gives me brain

Like she thinks I'm dumb
Grabs the crown of my dick and blows me to kingdom come
Till I feel anointed
She makes iller noises
When she's with me, must be from the Windy City
Pretty apparent, she's a MILF when blowin' me

'Cause I conned her into
Rippin' the condom in two (woo)
Dick is a bargaining tool
Now I'm gettin' blew like Klonopins, Rude Jude
I go there, you wouldn't?
Well, I still have a few views in common with you
Just not YouTube, 'cause

I'm at your throat like chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with, 'plex with
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah

You're a has-been
That has been the case since back when
You last went and threw your hat in the race
You've been trash, stick your raps in the trash bin
Or end up in my next rhyme
You're a fuckboy, so next time
It's gonna be heads flyin' like Dez Bryant
With a TEC-9 against Rex Ryan (yeah)

Now watch me set it like correct time
All you get is sloppy seconds like a Timex, I
Clock rejects into the next life
Talkin' reckless, but it's just my
Strongest suit, but you can get my Columbian neck tie
Prostitute, just climb in the Humvee and let's ride

Why you hitching at night?
I put an end to your life, sex crime
Kidding aside, insidious vibe
Girl, you know you got the prettiest eyes
But all you're getting is bribe
Ending your life to try to get you inside
Then we gon' end up spending the night
And I'm skinning your hide like an Indian tribe

What kind of nut drives a Budweiser truck
Finds a slut, tries to surprise her, cuffs, ties her up
Binds up, cuts, slices her twice?
But the muff diver must just like it rough
Fuck right in her vagina, blood
Flies up on the visor, like a geyser, uh
(Music, please)

Enthusiast of the roofie
Goal is to get a floozy inside the Jacuzzi
And have a loosey-goosey as Cool C is with an Uzi
But I am to rap what blue jeans mean to Bruce Springsteen
Glued we be, I'm truTV, you're too PG
I'm Schoolly D, you're Spoonie Gee

No diss there, just notice there
Are no similarities that we share
Besides the fact we breathe air
Happily married to rap and I'm glad that we buried
The hatchet and patched it up
Now I'm back to ratchet up my attack
And I'm at your motherfuckin' throat like

Chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with, 'plex with
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah

And I'll take a hundred of you, hundred of you
All at once like I had nothin' to lose, what can I do?
My appetite for destruction is loose, destruction is loose
And all it wants is to have somethin' to chew
Somethin' to chew (somethin' to chew)"
Owl City,The Real World,"I saw the autumn leaves
Peel up off the street
Take wing on the balmy breeze
And sweep you off your feet
And you blushed as they scooped you up
On sugar maple wings
To gaze down on the city below
Ablaze with wondrous things

Downy feathers kiss your face
And flutter everywhere
Reality is a lovely place
But I wouldn't want to live there
I wouldn't want to live there

Weighed down by heavy lids
And lunar lullabies
I knew you were wide awake
'Cause you smile with your eyes

Downy feathers kiss your face
And flutter everywhere
Reality is a lovely place
But I wouldn't want to live there

From the green belt balcony
The wildfires look so pretty
Ponderosa canopy
I'd never leave if it were up to me
To the ruby redwood tree
And to the velvet climbing ivy
Painted all mahogany
I'd never leave if it were up to me
(If it were up to me)

With a starry brush
Paint the dusk venetian blue
'Cause in the evening hush
You'll never believe the view
And when the leaves return
And their whisperings fill the night
They'll freeze and burn
Where fire and ice collide
Where fire and ice collide

Can you feel a silk embrace
In the satin air?
If we dissolve without a trace
Would the real world even care?
Downy feathers kiss your face
And flutter everywhere
Reality is a lovely place
But I wouldn't want to live there
I wouldn't want to live there

I saw the autumn leaves
Peel up off the street
Take wing on the balmy breeze
And sweep you off your feet"
Owl City,Deer In The Headlights,"Met a girl in the parking lot
And all I did was say hello
Her pepper spray made it rather hard
For me to walk her home
But I guess that's the way it goes

Tell me again was it love at first sight
When I walked by and you caught my eye?
Didn't you know love could shine this bright?
Well smile, because you're the deer in the headlights

Met a girl with a graceful charm
But when beauty met the beast, he froze
Got the sense I was not her type
By the black eye and bloody nose
But I guess that's the way it goes

Tell me again was it love at first sight
When I walked by and you caught my eye?
Didn't you know love could shine this bright?
Well smile, because you're the deer in the headlights

It's suffocating to say
But the female mystique takes my breath away
So give me a smile or give me a sneer
'Cause I'm trying to guess here

Tell me again was it love at first sight
When I walked by and you caught my eye?
Didn't you know love could shine this bright?
I'm sorry I ever tried (deer in the headlights)

Tell me again was it love at first sight
When I walked by and you caught my eye?
Didn't you know love could shine this bright?
If life was a game you would never play nice
If love was a beam you'd be blind in both eyes
Put your sunglasses on, 'cause you're the deer in the headlights

You're the deer in the headlights
You're the deer in the headlights"
Owl City,Angels,"Wake me if you're out there

Through the glass in my bedroom window
In the bushes far below
I thought I saw an unfamiliar shadow
Among the ones I so clearly know

I've been sleeping with the night light unplugged
With a note on the rocking chair
That says, ""I'm dreaming of the life I once loved,
So wake me if you're out there.""

Living close to the ground
Is seventh heaven 'cause there are angels all around
Among my frivolous thoughts
I believe there are beautiful things seen by the astronauts
Wake me if you're out there

Wake me if you're out there

In the dust on my cellar staircase
A pair of footprints followed me
I saw a flicker in the fake fireplace
Blinked again but there was nothing to see

I've been leaving all the windows unlocked
With a basket by the oak tree
'Cause I'll be pickin' up the acorns that fall off
If you'll be climbing up to meet me

Living close to the ground
Is seventh heaven 'cause there are angels all around
Among my frivolous thoughts
I believe there are beautiful things seen by the astronauts
Wake me if you're out there

I keep my knees black and blue 
'Cause they often hit the hard wood floor
(Wake me if you're out there)
And I believe, so I'm not praying to the ceiling anymore

I've been sleeping with the night light unplugged
With a note on the rocking chair
That says, ""I'm dreaming of the life I once loved,
So wake me if you're out there.""

Living close to the ground
Is seventh heaven 'cause there are angels all around
Among my frivolous thoughts
I believe there are beautiful things seen by the astronauts

The indications reveal
(Wake me if you're out there)
That few of us realize life is quite surreal
So if you're dying to see
I guarantee there are angels around your vicinity
So if you're dying to see
I guarantee there are angels around your vicinity"
Owl City,Dreams Don't Turn To Dust,"Splash down in the silver screen
Into a deep dramatic scene
I swim through the theater
Or maybe I'm just a dreamer
Like a kite in the bright midday
Wonder stole my breath away
Shy sonata for Mercury
The stars always sing so pretty
 
This picnic will soon depart
Real life, I'm sad to see you go
I'll miss you with all my heart
But I'd rather be alone
'Cause I couldn't live without
Sunsets that dazzle in the dusk
So I'll drag the anchor up
And rest assured, 'cause dreams don't turn to dust

Dreams don't turn to dust
 
I made for the countryside
And my eyes never grew so wide
Apple raspberry river blue
I don't wanna leave without you
In the sound I'll gladly drown
Into the emerald underground
I rub my eyes 'cause it's hard to see
Surrounded by all this beauty

This picnic will soon depart
Real life, I'm sad to see you go
I'll miss you with all my heart
But I'd rather be alone
'Cause I couldn't live without
Sunsets that dazzle in the dusk
So I'll drag the anchor up
And rest assured, 'cause dreams don't turn to dust

(I'm sad to see you go)
(But I'd rather be alone)

When tiger eyes begin making you blush
And when diamonds boast that they can't be crushed
Let 'em go, 'cause dreams don't turn to dust

Real life, I'm sad to see you go
I'll miss you with all my heart
But I'd rather be alone

I'll rest assured 'cause dreams don't turn to dust"
Owl City,Honey And The Bee,"Don't remind me
That some days I'm a windshield
And other days I'm just a lucky bug
As cold iron rails leave
Old mossy trails through the countryside

The crow and the bean field
Are my best friends but
Boy, I need a hug (boy, I need a hug)
'Cause my heart stops without you
There's something about you 
That makes me feel alive

If the green left the grass on the other side
I would make like a tree and leave
But if I reached for your hand, would your eyes get wide?
Who knew the other side could be so green?

Don't remind me
I'm a chickadee in love with the sky
But that's clearly not a lot to crow about
'Cause when the stars silhouette me
I'm scared they'll forget me
And flicker out

I chase honey but I haven't seen the hive
Yeah I didn't look, I didn't even try
But still my heart stops without you
'Cause there's something about you 
That makes me feel alive

If the green left the grass on the other side
I would make like a tree and leave
But if I reached for your hand, would your eyes get wide?
Who knew the other side could be so green?

We are honey and the bee

Backyard of butterflies surrounded me
I fell in love with you, like bees to honey
So let's up and leave the weeping to the willow tree
And pour our tears in the sea

I swear there's a lot of vegetables out there
That crop up for air
Yeah I never thought we were two peas in a pod
Until you suddenly bloomed, then I knew
That I'd always love you
(Oh, I'll always love you too)

If the green left the grass on the other side
I would make like a tree and leave
But if I reached for your hand, would your eyes get wide?
Who knew the other side could be so green?
If the green left the grass on the other side
I would make like a tree and leave
But if I reached for your hand, would your eyes get wide?
Who knew the other side could be so green?

And if I reached for your hand for the rest of my life
Who knew the other side could be so green?"

Where cherry bombs stain the blackbirds red

My captain on a snowy horse
Is coming back to take me home
He'll find me fighting back a terrible force

Owl City,"January 28, 1986","Ladies and gentlemen,
Today is a day for mourning and remembering.
They had a hunger to explore the universe and discover its truths.
And they had that special grace,
That special spirit that says, ""Give me a challenge, and I'll meet it with joy.""
The crew of the space shuttle Challenger honored us with the manner in which they lived their lives.
We will never forget them as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye
And slipped the surly bonds of earth... To touch the face of God."
Owl City,Galaxies,"Call back the cap-com, tick off the time-bomb

Owl City,Hospital Flowers,"I survived a dreadful accident
In the car crash of the century
My shattered hopes collapsed on cold cement
But in the back of the ambulance, I never felt so content

A high-speed collision gave a new sense of sight to me
And now my vision can render the scene
A blurry image of wreckage and roadside debris
Happiness returned to me through a grave emergency

Da da da, da da da
Da da da, da da da

I tossed and turned in sterile apathy
Until the violets arrived for me
The bouquet burst and blossoms filled the room
And the place got smaller as they grew taller
And taught me to bloom

A high-speed collision gave a new sense of sight to me
And now my vision can render the scene
A blurry image of wreckage and roadside debris
Happiness returned to me through a grave emergency

The curtains decayed
The daylight poured in
I was never afraid
Of the darkness again
My burns were third-degree
But I'd been set free
'Cause grace had finally found its way to me

A high-speed collision gave a new sense of sight to me
And now my vision can render the scene
A blurry image of wreckage and roadside debris
Happiness returned to me (Da da da, da da da)

When the engines cough, and you blast off
Ignite the night with a firecracker flash

When the stars collide and your eyes grow wide
Take it in with your breath against the glass

Remember to dream 'cause it's gonna be a starry night
Over every town, as you look down
So harmonize with the singing satellites
Remember to scream 'cause you're gonna be lost for words
When the sparks erupt and they light you up
Dip your toes in the galaxy, 'cause it's yours to explore tonight

Roller coaster through the atmosphere

Where it never hurts diving in head first

My rock candy passion is bittersweet, and armed to the teeth
'Cause she would rather fall in chocolate than fall in love 
Especially with me

I stood under the waterfall
With a kiwi-pineapple parasol
As Cinderella dropped the crystal ball
And made a concrete cavern 
A caterpillar concert hall

I wish that we could sail our sad days away forever
In deep blue seas of paper mâché (Let's dance in the moonlight)
A barracuda chased our dog days away forever
Let's sink or swim 'til we fall in love (And dance in the moonlight)
When we join the yacht club

I would rather go swimming with great white sharks
Than wade in romance
'Cause I can never find the courage to ask her to dinner
Or even to dance (Dance in the moonlight)

Don't sweat under your overcoat
'Cause my heart can harbor this paddle boat
You'll hit the bottom of the highest note
And the chatty tree frogs will never wanna leave your throat

I wish that we could sail our sad days away forever

And plug in the party lights
Soak your cares in the solar flares
That light up these island nights
Orange eclipse I can taste your lips
In the citrus afternoon
If you can fly don't stop at the sky
'Cause there's footprints on the moon

So I won't feel dead anymore
So I won't feel dead anymore

I saw a bear in the den
Readin' my textbooks again
Bats float like traffic as they poured from the attic
Heaven knows I could really use a friend

Quartet of crickets chime in for the chorus

Eminem,Nowhere Fast (feat. Kehlani) - Extended Version,"Ashes blowing in the air
The world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin' back and we're never getting old
'Cause the skies are black, but our heart's made of gold
Fuck doin' what you're told
We're goin' nowhere fast

I feel sorry for this beat, sympathy pains for this track
This road is takin' me back down memory lane with this rap
I can still look out in this crowd, be wowed and be taken aback
I'm simply stating a fact, I had Wembley Stadium packed

But now we're on a path headed to nowhere and fast
Another terrorist attacks
Like a tariff, blows half of Madison Square up, alas
We perish in the blast
But that isn't scaring us, we pass nowhere we're fearless
'Cause we're just

Ashes blowing in the air
Our world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah
(We don't give a... no, no)
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin' back and we're never getting old
'Cause the skies are black
But our heart's made of gold (golden)
Fuck doin' what you're told (what we're told)
We're goin' nowhere fast

'Cause we're goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' nowhere
We're on the run of our lives
Goin' nowhere fast

Fuck doin' what you're told, act like a two-year old
Shit is soon to go kaboom and blow
Anyways; for MC's it's a funeral
When I'm devisin' this rhyme
'Cause I'm awake and you're mourning
That's why I rise and I shine
Like a new day has dawned on me

Gusto, guts, bravado
Nuts and plus I kick up dust and cuss a lot
I musta got you in somewhat of a debacle
'Cause some stuff that's awful
Really don't mean nothin' although
There's a lot of shit I said in jest that's tough to swallow

But if at times my heart it seems
Like it's in the wrong place
It's probably 'cause it's on my sleeve
Keanu Reeves speed of life, avoid or veer
Or just steer toward it, we're only lookin' forward
But where we're goin', we have no idea

Nowhere to go, but hysterical, it's gettin' warm in here
I set the world on fire, was born to be an arsonist
Just one spark and it's lit
But I'mma still get dark on this shit
Told you I'd leave my mark on this bitch-war machine

But you forced me in a corner
I'm sure to have somethin' for your rear
And in the course of the assault as torture gets more severe
Go to war with me, you'll end up blew to Timbuktu
I send at you a ten-ton nuke like Kim Jong-Un
And end up ruinin' your career

But when all is said and done
And at the end of my run I'll just rewind clocks, forever young
Make time stop, will I ever fall off? That day will never come
Till the pine box, bitch, fuck you! I'm better than I ever was
Till the bomb drops, hope it never does
But I'm not gonna sweat it 'cause
This world's screwed, it's already fucked
And I'm on top, so everyone's just

Ashes blowing in the air (so we're...)
Our world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah

'Cause we're goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' nowhere
We're on the run of our lives
Goin' nowhere fast

You can't tell us nothin'
Hard-headed and we're stubborn
So, one ear and out the other when we're young, we're young
(We're on the run of our lives)
Who knows what the future for us could hold
Another shooter? Uh oh
(We're on the run of our lives)
No more tomorrows, we're done
And all we are is-

Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin' back and we're never getting old
'Cause the skies are black
But our heart's made of gold (golden)
Fuck doin' what you're told (what we're told)
We're goin' nowhere fast

(Post-Chorus: Kehlani)
'Cause we're goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' nowhere
We're on the run of our lives
Goin' nowhere fast"
Lana Del Rey,Young And Beautiful,"I've seen the world, done it all
Had my cake now
Diamonds, brilliant
And Bel Air now

Hot summer nights, mid-July
When you and I were forever wild
The crazy days, city lights
The way you'd play with me like a child

Will you still love me
When I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me
When I've got nothing but my achin' soul?

I know you will
I know you will
I know that you will
Will you still love me
When I'm no longer beautiful?

I've seen the world, lit it up
As my stage now
Channeling angels in
The new age now

Hot summer days, rock and roll
The way you'd play for me at your show
And all the ways I got to know
Your pretty face and electric soul

Will you still love me
When I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me
When I've got nothing but my achin' soul?

I know you will
I know you will
I know that you will
Will you still love me
When I'm no longer beautiful?

Dear Lord, when I get to Heaven
Please let me bring my man
When he comes, tell me that you'll let him in
Father, tell me if you can

All that grace, all that body
All that face, makes me wanna party
He's my sun, he makes me shine
Like diamonds

Will you still love me
When I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me
When I've got nothing but my achin' soul?

I know you will
I know you will
I know that you will
Will you still love me
When I'm no longer beautiful?

Will you still love me
When I'm no longer beautiful?
Will you still love me
When I'm not young and beautiful?"
Lana Del Rey,Summertime Sadness,"Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best

I got my red dress on tonight
Dancin' in the dark in the pale moonlight
Done my hair up real big, beauty queen style
High heels off, I'm feelin' alive

Oh my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above
Are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore
(One, two, three, four)

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best

I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness

I'm feelin' electric tonight
Cruisin' down the coast, goin' about 99
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight

Oh my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above
Are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore
(One, two, three, four)

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best

I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness

Think I'll miss you forever
Like the stars miss the sun in the morning sky
Later's better than never
Even if you're gone I'm gonna drive

I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best

I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness"
Lana Del Rey,Born To Die,"Why? Who, me? Why?

Feet, don't fail me now
Take me to the finish line
Oh, my heart, it breaks
Every step that I take
But I'm hoping at the gates
They'll tell me that you're mine

Walking through the city streets
Is it by mistake or design?
I feel so alone on the Friday night
Can you make it feel like home
If I tell you you're mine?
It's like I told you honey

Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough
And the road gets tough, I don't know why
Keep making me laugh, let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
So choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die

Lost but now I am found
I can see but once I was blind
I was so confused as a little child
Try'na take what I could get
Scared that I couldn't find
All the answers, honey

Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough
And the road gets tough, I don't know why
Keep making me laugh, let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
So choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die
(We were born, we were born) We were born to die
(We were born, we were born) We were born to die

Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane

So, don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough
And the road gets tough, I don't know why
Keep making me laugh, let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
So choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die

Eminem,Headlights,"Mom, I know I let you down
And though you say the days are happy
Why's the power off and I'm fucked up
And mom, I know he's not around
But don't you place the blame on me
As you pour yourself another drink, yeah

I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

I went in headfirst, never thinking about who what I said hurt
In what verse, my mom probably got it the worst, the brunt of it
But as stubborn as we are, did I take it too far
""Cleaning Out My Closet"" and all them other songs but regardless I don't hate you 'cause ma

You're still beautiful to me, 'cause you're my mom
Though far be it from you to be calm, our house was Vietnam
Desert Storm and both of us put together can form an atomic bomb
Equivalent to chemical warfare and forever we can drag this on and on

But, agree to disagree, that gift for me up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me
You're kicking me out, it's 15 degrees and it's Christmas Eve (Little prick just leave)
Ma let me grab my fucking coat, anything to have each other's goats
Why we always at each other's throats, 'specially when dad he fucked us both

We're in the same fucking boat, you'd think that it'd make us close, nope
Further away that drove us, but together headlights shine and car full of belongings
Still got a ways to go, back to grandma's house it's straight up the road
And I was the man of the house, the oldest, so my shoulders carried the weight of the load

Then Nate got taken away by the state at 8 years old, and
That's when I realized you were sick and it wasn't fixable or changeable
And to this day we remained estranged and I hate it though, but

I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

'Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though
'Cause you ain't even get to witness your grandbabies grow
But I'm sorry mama for ""Cleaning Out My Closet"", at the time I was angry
Rightfully maybe so, never meant that far to take it though, 'cause

Now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not making jokes
That song I no longer play at shows and I cringe every time it's on the radio
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home and all the medicine you fed us
And how I just wanted you to taste your own, but

Now the medication's takin' over and your mental state's deteriorating slow
And I'm way too old to cry, the shit is painful though
But ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan yo
All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both

Foster care, that cross you bare, few may be as heavy as yours
But I love you Debbie Mathers, oh what a tangled web we have, 'cause
One thing I never asked was, where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keeping up with every address

But I'dve flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus
Owned a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
Someone ever moved them from me, that you could've bet your asses
If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa, kidnap 'em

And although one has only met their grandma
Once, you pulled up in our drive one night as we were leaving to get some hamburgers
Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you
And as you left I had this, overwhelming sadness come over me

As we pulled off to go our separate paths, and
I saw your headlights as I looked back
And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to
Thank you for being my Mom and my Dad

So Mom, please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet
I guess I had to get this off my chest
I hope I get the chance to lay it 'fore I'm dead
The stewardess said to fasten my seat belt, I guess we're crashing

So if I'm not dreaming, I hope you get this message that I will always love you from afar
'Cause you're my ma

I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

I want a new life (start over)
One without a cause (clean slate)
So I'm coming home tonight
Well no matter what the cost

And if the plane goes down
Or if the crew can't wake me up
Well just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die

Oh, even if there's songs to sing
Well my children will carry me
Just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die

Because I put my faith in my new girl
So I never say goodbye cruel world
Just know that I'm alright
I am not afraid to die

I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
I want a new life"
Eminem,Cold Wind Blows,"'Cause some things just, don't change
It's better when they stay the same
Although the whole world knows your name
So on a, bigger stage they came to see you spit your game, oh
But it shouldn't be difficult, to explain
Just why you came back again, you hate the fame
Love the game, cold as ice, you remain
Fuck 'em all, tell 'em all, eat shit, here we go again

Spoken:
So, goddamn.
Is it that time again already?
Haha, y'all don't look too happy to see me.
Fuck man, don't everybody welcome me back at once?
All right, fuck y'all then.

You can get the dick, just call me the ball sac, I'm nuts
Michael Vick in this bitch dog, fall back, you mutts
Fuck your worms, you've never seen such a sick puppy
Fuck it a sick duck, I want my duck-sicked, mommy
And my nuts licked, gobble 'em up trick, yummy
Bitch, you don't fuckin' think I know that you suck dick, dummy
You'll get your butt kicked, fuck all that love shit, honey
Yeah I laugh when I call you a slut, it's funny
Shorty, dance while I diss you to the beat, fuck the words
You don't listen to 'em anyway, yeah struck a nerve sucka
Motherfucka' might as well let my lips pucker
Like Elton John, 'cause I'm just a mean cock-sucker
This shit is on 'cause you went and pissed me off, now I'm shittin' and pissin' on
Everybody, give a fuck if it's right or wrong
So buck the Buddah, light a bong
But take a look at Mariah next time I inspire you to write a song (Come on)

Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh oh
I'm as cold as the cold wind, blows
When it snows, and it's twenty be-low
Ask me why, man I just don't, know
Kno-kno-know, know-know know
I'm as cold as the cold wind, blows
Blo-blo-blows, blow-blow blows
Oh oh-oh

Fuck it, I'm a loose cannon
Bruce Banner's back in the booth, y'all are sittin' ducks, I'm the only goose standin'
I'll set the world on fire, piss on it put it out
Stick my dick in a circle, but I'm not fuckin' around
Mo'fucker, I'll show you pussyfootin'
I'll kick a bitch in the cunt, 'til it makes a queef, and sounds like a fuckin' whoopee cushion
Who the fuck is you pushin', you must have mistook me for some
Sissy soft punk, lookin' for some nookie or bosom
Go ahead fuckin' hater push me, I told you ain't no fuckin' way to shush me
Call me a faggot, 'cause I hate a pussy
Man the fuck up sissy, G's up, all you gardeners freeze up
Put your hoes down, Shady ease up
Man chill, naw I can't goddammit, rap is a landfill
Drop the anvil, these are shoes that you can't fill
Shit the day that happens, the world will
Stop spinnin' and Michael J. Fox'll, come to a stand-still

Durin' an earthquake, urine in your face 'cause you're fake
Ow what the fuck, that hurt, wait
Ow what the fuck, I just got struck
By lightnin', alright then I quit, God I give up
Call it evil that men do, Lord forgive me for what my pen do
This is for your sins, I cleanse you
You can repent but I warn you, if you continue
To Hell I'll send you, and just then the wind blew, and I said...

Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh oh
I'm as cold as the cold wind, blows
When it snows, and it's twenty be-low
Ask me why, man I just don't...
Know, kno-kno-know, know-know know
I'm as cold as the cold wind, blows
Blo-blo-blows, blow-blow blows
Oh oh-oh oh-oh

How long will I be this way, Shady until my dyin' day
'Til I hang up the mic and it's time for me to say
So long, 'til then I'll drop the fuckin' bombs
Like I missed the pass when I went long
If you don't like it you can kiss my ass in a lint thong
Now sing along, slut this, slut that, learn the words to the song
Oh bitches don't like that, homie I'll be nicer to women
When Aquaman drowns and the Human Torch starts swimmin'
Man I'm a, cold soul, I roll solo so don't compare
Me, to them other bums over there
It's like apples to oranges, peaches to plums, yeah
I'm bananas pussy, cut off the grapes and grow a pair
But I swear, you try to dis me I'll slaughter you
I put that on everything, like everyone does with auto-tune
The last thing you wanna do is have me spit out a rhyme
And say I was writin' this and I thought of you, so...

Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh oh
I'm as cold as the cold wind, blows
When it snows, and it's twenty be-low
Ask me why, man I just don't...
Know, kno-kno-know, know-know know
I'm as cold as the cold wind, blows
Blo-blo-blows, blow-blow blows
Oh oh-oh oh-oh

I don't know... I don't know what caused...
I don't know what caused me to be this way
I don't know... I don't know but I'll...
Probably be this way 'til my dyin' day
I don't know why I'm so... I'm so cold
Mean things I don't mean to say
I guess this is how you made me"
Eminem,On Fire,"Heh, yeah, haha
You know critics man, critics never got nothing nice to say man
You know the one thing I noticed about critics, man
Is critics never asked me how my day went
Well, I'ma tell 'em

Yesterday my dog died, I hog tied a ho, tied her in a bow
Said next time you blog, try to spit a flow
You wanna criticize dog, try a little mo'
I'm so tired of this, I could blow, fire in the hole

I'm fired up so fire up the lighter and the dro
Better hold on a little tighter, here I go
Flow's tighter, hot headed as ghost rider, cold hearted
As Spider-Man throwin' a spider in the snow

So you better get lower than Flo-Rida inside of a low-rider
With no tires in the hole
Why am I like this, why is winter cold
Why is it when I talk, I'm so biased to the ho's

Listen dog, Christmas is off, this is as soft as it gets
This isn't golf, this is a blisterin' assault
Those are your wounds, this is the salt
So get lost, shit, dissin' me is just like pissin' off

The Wizard of Oz, wrap a lizard in gauze
Beat you in the jaws with it, grab the scissors and saws
And cut out your livers, gizzards and balls
Throw you in the middle of the ocean in a blizzard with Jaws

So sip piss like sizzurp through a straw
Then describe how it tasted like dessert to us all
Got the gall to make Chris piss in his drawers
Tickle him, go to his grave, skip him and visit his dog

You're on fire
That's how you know you're on a roll
'Cause when you're hot, it's like you're burning up, everyone else is cold
You're on fire
Man, I'm so fuckin' sick
I got ambulances pullin' me over and shit

You're on fire
You need to stop, drop and roll
'Cause when you say the shit to get the whole Hip-Hop shop to blow
You're on fire, yeah, you're on fire

I just put a bullshit hook
In between two long ass verses, if you mistook this for a song, look
This ain't a song, it's a warnin' to Brooke
Hogan and David Cook, that the crook just took over, so book

Run as fast as you can, stop writing and kill it
I'm lightnin' in a skillet, you're a fuckin' flash in the pan
I pop up, you bitches scatter
Like hot grease splashin' a fan, Mr. Mathers is the man

Yeah, I'm pissed but I would rather take this energy and stash it in a can
Come back and whip your ass with it again
Saliva's like sulfuric acid in your hand
It'll eat through anything, metal, the ass of Iron Man

Turn him into plastic, so for you to think that you could stand
A fuckin' chance is asinine, yeah ask Denaun, man
Hit a blind man with a coloring book and told him color inside the lines
Or get hit with a flying crayon

Fuck it, I ain't playin'
Pull up in a van and hop out on a homeless man holdin' a sign sayin'
Vietnam Vet, I'm out my fuckin' mind, man
Kick over the can, beat his ass and leave him nine grand

So if I seem a little mean to you
This ain't savage, you ain't never seen a brute
You wanna get graphic, we can go the scenic route
You couldn't make a bulimic puke on a piece of fuckin' corn and peanut poop

Sayin' you sick, quit playin' you prick, don't nobody care
And why the fuck am I yellin' at air
I ain't even talkin' to no one 'cause ain't nobody there
Nobody'll fuckin' test me 'cause these ho's won't even dare

I'm wastin' punch lines but I got so many to spare
I just thought of another one that might go here
Naw, don't waste it, save it psycho, yeah
Plus you gotta rewrite those lines that you said about Michael's hair

You're on fire
That's how you know you're on a roll
'Cause when you're hot, it's like you're burning up, everyone else is cold
You're on fire
Man, I'm so, im so hot
My muthafuckin' fire truck's on fire, homie

You're on fire
You need to stop, drop and roll
'Cause when you say the shit to get the whole Hip-Hop Shop to blow
You're on fire, yeah, you're on fire"

Fuck a steak slut, I'll cut my toes off

Listen garden tool, don't make me introduce you to my power tool
You know the fuckin' drill
How you douchebags feel, knowin' you're disposable
Summer's Eve, Massengil

Shady's got that mass appeal, baby crank this shit 'cause it's your God damn jam
You say that you want your punch lines a little more compact, well shorty I'm that man

Girl forget remorse, I'ma hit you broads with Chris' force like you pissed him off

Talented with the tongue, mo'fucker you ain't got a lick in yours
Hittin' licks like I'm robbin' liquor stores, makin' cash registers shit their drawers
Think you spit the rawest, I'm an uncooked slab of beef layin' on your kitchen floor
Other words, I'm off the meat rack, bring the beat back, bring me two extension cords

I'ma measure my dick, shit I need six inches more, fuck, my dick's big
Bitch, need I remind you that I don't need the fuckin' swine flu to be a sick pig
You're addicted, I'm dope, I'm the longest needle around here, need a fix up
I'm the big shot, get it, dick snots, you're just small pokes, little pricks (ha)

Girl you think that other pricks hot, I'll drink gasoline and eat a lit match

Gettin' circles wrapped around it like you do when I come through, I'd like you to
Remind yourself of what the fuck I can do when I'm on the mic, girl, you're the kind of girl that I can take a likin' to

Psych, I'm spikin' you like a football, been this way since I stood a foot tall
You're a good catch with a shitty spouse, got a pretty mouth and a good jaw
Give me good brain, watch the wood grain, don't want no cum stain, bitch you listening
Tryin' to turn me down, slut I'm talkin' to you, turn me back up, are you insane?

Tryin' to talk over me in the car, shut the fuck up while my shit's playing
I'm a shit stain on the underwear of life, what's the saying, where there's thunder, there's lightning
And they say that it never stikes twice in the same place
Then how the fuck have I been hit six times in three different locations on four separate occasions

And you can bet your stinkin' ass that I've come to smash everything in my path
Fork was in the road, took the psycho path, poison ivy wouldn't have me thinkin' rash
So hit the dance floor, cutie, while I do my duty on this microphone, shake your booty
Shorty I'm the shit, why you think Proof used to call me Doody

Better watch out now 'cause here we come
And we ain't stoppin' until we see the mornin' sun
So give us room to do our thing 'cause we ain't come to hurt no one
So everybody come and get up on the floor now and grab someone

Man first of all I'm a boss, I just wanna get that across
Man, even my dentist hates when I floss
Pull up to the club in a Pinto like it's a Porsche
Garbage bag for one of the windows, spray-painted doors

With the flames on 'em, Michigan plates and my name's on 'em
Baby, Shady's here, come and get him if you dames want him
But he ain't stupid so quit tryin' to run them games on him
He's immune to Cupid, why you tryin' to put your claims on him

'Cause you won't do to me what you did to the last man
Now climb in back, try not to kick over the gas can
There's a half a gallon in it, that could be our last chance
We have of just gettin' home, now can I get that lap dance

She's got a tattoo of me right above her ass, man
In the streets of Warren, Michigan, we call em tramp stamps
That means she belongs to me, time to put the damn clamps
Down and show this hussy who's the man, now get amped, dance

Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nuttin but a white trash party (white trash party)

So let's have us a little bash
And if anyone asks, it ain't no one but us trash
You don't know, ya better ask somebody
'Cause we're havin' a white trash party (white trash party)

Pull a 5th of Bacardi from out of my underwear
And walk around the party without a care like a body without a head
Lookin' like a zombie from Night of the Livin' Dead
And tomorrow probably still be too high to get out of bed

Till I feel like I've been hit with the sharp part of the hammer
Mixin' Hennessy and Fanta with Pepto and Mylanta
I shoot the gift like im hollerin', ""Die Santa!""
Missed the tree and hit Rudolf and 2 innocent bystanders

So quit tryin' to play the Wall like you're Paul and
Get on the floor when the beat drops and stop stallin'
They call me the Stephon Marbury of rap darlin'
'Cause as soon as they throw on some R. Kelly, I start ballin'

Makin' it rain for the ladies in the Mini's
But im not throwin' ones, five, tens or even twenties
I'm throwin' quarters, nickels, dimes, pennies up at Skinny's
Man, I do this for them bunnies up at Denny's

From the north, east and west but when it comes to them trailers in them Southparks
Muffle it 'cause homie that hood's tighter than Kenny's
So ladies, if your belly button's not an innie then im outtie
Now hop in my mini-van, let's get rowdy, come on

Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nuttin but a white trash party (white trash party)

So let's have us a little bash
And if anyone asks, it ain't no one but us trash
You don't know, ya better ask somebody
'Cause we're havin' a white trash party (white trash party)

Now whether your black, white or purple, if you're misunderstood
But you don't give a fuck, you ain't doin' shit that you should
Long as you know your up to evil and your no damn good
Get on the floor, man and rep yo hood

Now, honey, don't let them pricks trip, we should make a quick dip
And go do some donuts in the hospital parkin' lot 'cause, girl, I got a sick whip
Kick the back window out of my Gremlin, put two milk crates in the trunk
Rip out the stick shift and make a five seater
I'll be damned if I feed a chick, it ain't like me to split a piece of dry pita
I be the S-L to the I-M to the S-H-A-D-Y and I don't need a tank top to be a wife beater

I'll rip a tree out the ground and flip it upside down
'Fore I turn over a new leaf, clown
I'll tell ya now, I'm so raw, I still need to un-thaw
You feel me y'all, I'll shut the club down like Drake in the mall

But, baby, a body like that's against the law
You the baddest little chain with the blades I ever saw
Coleslaw containers, empty straw wrappers and all
You got more junk in your trunk than I do in my car, now get up

Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nuttin but a white trash party (white trash party)

So let's have us a little bash
And if anyone asks, it ain't no one but us trash
You don't know, ya better ask somebody
'Cause we're havin' a white trash party (white trash party)"
Eminem,Going Through Changes,"I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes

Lately I really, feel like, I'm rollin' for Delph like Philly
Feel like I'm losin' control of myself, I sincerely
Apologize if all that I sound like is I'm complainin'
But life keeps on complicatin'

And I'm debatin' on, leavin' this world this evenin'
Even my girls can see I'm grievin', I try and hide it
But I can't, why do I act like I'm all high and mighty
When inside I'm dyin', I am finally realizin' I need

Help, can't do it myself, too weak
Two weeks I've been havin' ups and downs, goin' through peaks
And valleys, dilly dallyin', 'round with the idea
Of endin' this shit right here

I'm hatin' my reflection, I walk around the house tryin' to fight in mirrors
I can't stand what I look like yeah
I look fat but what do I care, I give a fuck
Only thing I fear is Hailie, I'm afraid if I close my eyes then I might see her
Shit

I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes

I lock myself in the bedroom, bathroom, nappin' at noon
Yeah dad's in a bad mood, he's always snappin' at you
Marshall what happened that you can't stop with these pills
And you've fallen off with your skills and your own fans are laughin' at you

You've become a problem you're too pussy to tackle, get up
Be a man, stand, a real man would have had this shit handled
Know you just had your heart ripped out and crushed
They say Proof just flipped out, homie just whipped out and bust

Nah, it ain't like Doody to do that
He wouldn't fuckin' shoot at nobody, he'd fight first
But dwellin' on it only makes the night worse
Now I'm poppin' Vic's, Perc's and Methadone pills
Yeah Em, tight verse, you killed it

Fuckin' drug dealers hang around me like yes men
And they gon' do whatever I says when, I says it
It's in their best interest to protect their investment
And I just lost my fuckin', best friend, so fuck it I guess then

I'm going through changes
Don't know what I'm gonna do
But I just keep on going through changes
I'm going through changes

My friends just can't understand this new me
That's understandable man, but think how bananas you'd be
You'd be an animal too, if you were trapped in this fame and caged in it like a zoo
And everybody's lookin' at you, what you want me to do

I'm startin' to live like a recluse and the truth is
Fame's startin' to give me an excuse to be at a all time low
I sit alone in my home theater, watchin' the same damn DVD

Of the first tour, the last tour, he was still alive
And it hurt, so I fast forward, sleepin' pills will make me feel alright
And if I'm still awake in the middle of the night
I just take a couple more, yeah you're motherfuckin' right

I ain't slowin' down for no one, I am almost homeward bound
Almost in a coma, yeah homie come on dole 'em out
Daddy don't you die on me, daddy better hold your ground
Fuck, don't I know the sound of that voice, yeah baby hold me down

(Daddy)
I'm going through changes
(Daddy)
Don't know what I'm gonna do
But I just keep on going through changes
I'm going through changes

Wake up in the hospital, full of tubes, but somehow I'm pullin' through
Swear when I come back, I'ma be bulletproof
I'ma do it just for Proof, I think I should state a few
Facts, 'cause I may not get a chance again to say the truth

Shit, it just hit me that what if I would not have made it through
I think about the things I would never got to say to you
I'd never get to make it right, so here's what I came to do
Hailie this one is for you, Whitney and Alaina too

I still love your mother, that'll never change, think about her every day
We just could never get it together hey, wish there was a better way
For me to say it, but I swear on everything
I'd do anything for her, on any day

There are just too many things to explain, when it rains
Guess it pours, yes it does, wish there wasn't any pain
But I can't pretend there ain't, I ain't placin' any blame
I ain't pointin' fingers, heaven knows I never been a saint

I know that it feels like we just pissed away our history
And just today, I looked at your picture almost if to say
I miss you subconsciously, wish it didn't end this way
But I just had to get away, don't know why, I don't know what else to say

I guess I'm I'm going through changes
Don't know what I'm gonna do
But I just keep on going through changes
I'm going through changes"
Eminem,Seduction,"Spoken:
I don't know, man. Just feels like, we're a lot different.
Kinda feels like, I'm on a hole different page, right now.
Feels strange, but um, I guess it's kinda like, it's kinda like...

I feel like I'm morphin'
Into somethin' that's so incredible that I'm dwarfin'
All competitors, better get your girlfriend in check
It's psychological warfare, endorphins I effect

Your self-esteem shatters as dialect, comes blastin' out your deck
She loves me, so much passion you'd expect
This sort of reaction from her yet
You strong arm, you're fuckin' corny, you try to turn your charm on
'Cause you just think you're Bishop The Don Juan

But if you think that you're fuckin' with me, homie, you're on one
I'm cockin' my head back like Ed Lover, come on son
She's on my Johnson, she brings my name up constant
Your boys are like she's fuckin' with dude, she wants son

Homeboy you better get a clue
She's on my dick 'cause I spit better than you
What you expect her to do, how you expect her to act in the sack
When she's closin' her eyes
Fantasizin' of diggin' her nails in my back to this track

Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody whose as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you

Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody whose as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you

She's sittin' here gettin' liquored up at the bar
She says it's quicker to count the things that ain't wrong with you than to count the things that are
There's a seven disc CD changer in her car
And I'm in every single slot and your not, aww

I'm the logo on that Dallas Cowboy helmet, a star
And I'm not about to sit back and just keep rhymin' one syllable, naw
Switch it up and watch them haters not give it up
'Cause they're just not good enough but I'm not givin' up, till I get my respect

And I won't stop till I get enough 'cause I'm not livin' up to my own expectations
Aww, that hater alarm is soundin' off, man, Obama took the bomb from my name, aww
So quit cryin' that I took your dame homie, she's my dame, aww
You sadly mistaken if you're thinkin' that I'm not on my game, boy

And things just ain't been the same since the day that I came forth
You wear your heart on your sleeve, I sport that white tank boy
But you got a hard on for me, what you hollerin' my name for
It's your bitch on my dick, ain't my dang fault, man, I can't call it

Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody whose as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you

Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody whose as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you

It's like we're playin' lyrical tug-of-war with your ear, you hear it, girl come here
Put your ear up to the speaker, dear, while I freak this world premier
Seducin' her, loosen up with a little freestyle, that'll wait, am I losin' ya
Am I makin' you look bad, well I got news for ya, homie you're losin' her

Oh wait, you don't like when I spit it fast, am I tryin' to show out, let me slow it down some
It's still gonna be a blow out, you're gonna wanna throw out your whole album
Rummage through the shit and try to salvage somethin' to see
If you can save any of it punk but none of it's fuckin' with me

Prick, you really feelin' that bullshit, you think you killin' them syllables
Quit playin', these beats ain't nuttin to fool with
They call me Fire Marshall, I shut this shit down
Your entire arsenal is not enough to fuck with one round

I am also the opposite of what you are like
You're a microcosm of what the fuck I am on the mic
I am awesome and you are just awe struck, she's love stricken
She's got her jaw struck from suckin' my dick, aww fuck

Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody whose as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you

Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody whose as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you"
Eminem,No Love,"Lil Wayne
Throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
But it's Fuck the world, get a child out her
Yeah my life a bitch, but you know nothin' bout her
Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers

I'm rollin' Sweets, I'm smokin' sour
Married to the game, but she broke her vows
That's why my bars are full of broken bottles
And my night stands are full of open Bibles, uh

I think about more than I forget
But I don't go around fire, expectin' not to sweat
And these niggas know I lay 'em down, make your bed
Bitches try to kick me while I'm down, I'll break your leg

Money outweighin', problems on the triple beam
I'm stickin' to the script, you nigga's skippin' scenes
Uh, be good or be good at it
Fuckin' right I've got my gun, semi-Cartermatic

Yeah, put the dick in they mouth, so I guess it's fuck what they say
I'm high as a bitch, up up and away, man I come down in a couple of days
Okay, you want me up in the cage, then I'll come out in beast mode
I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G-code

It's Weezy motherfucker, Blood gang and I'm in bleed mode
All about my dough, but I don't even check the peephole
So you can keep knockin', but won't knock me down
No love lost, no love found

Eminem
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now

Lil Wayne
Yeah

Eminem
You kicked me when I was down, fuck what you say just don't

Lil Wayne
That's right (Don't hurt me)
I don't need you (No more)
Don't want to see you (No more)

Lil Wayne

Eminem
I'm alive again, more alive than I have been in my whole entire life I can
See these people's ears perk up as I begin to spaz with the pen
I'm a little bit sicker than most, shit's fi'in to get thick again
They say the competition is stiff, but I get a hard dick from this shit, now stick it in

I ain't never givin' in again, caution to the wind, complete freedom
Look at these rappers how I treat 'em, so why the fuck would I join 'em when I beat 'em?
They call me a freak 'cause I like to spit on these pussies 'fore I eat 'em
Man get these whack cocksuckers off stage, where the fuck is Kanye when you need him?

Snatch the mic from 'em, bitch I'ma let you finish in a minute, yeah that rap is tight but I'm
'Bout to spit the greatest verse of all time, so you might want to go back to the lab tonight and um
Scribble out them rhymes you were going to spit, and start over from scratch and write new ones
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference, when I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight

It's an adrenaline rush, you feel the bass thump in the place all the way to the parking lot fellow
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd, you can see the sparks from hot metal
Cold-hearted from the day I bogarted the game, my soul started to rot fellow
When I'm not even in my harshest, you can still get roasted 'cause Marsh is not mellow

Till I'm toppling from the top I'm not going to stop, I'm standing on my Monopoly board
That means I'm on top of my game and it don't stop, till my hip don't hop anymore
When you're so good that you can't say it, 'cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore
People just get sick 'cause you spit, these fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore

And you can never break my stride, you never slow the momentum at any moment
I'm 'bout to blow, you'll never take my pride, I'm killin' the flow, slow venom any opponent
Is getting no mercy, mark my words ain't letting up relentless, I smell blood
I don't give a fuck, keep giving 'em hell, where was you when I fell and needed help up? You get no love

It's a little too late, to say that you're sorry now

Eminem,Cinderella Man,"You know technically, I'm not even supposed to be here right now
So fuck it
Some of us don't get a second chance

Who can catch lightnin' in a bottle, set fire to water
Comin' out the nozzle on a fire hose, flyer than swatters
(Cinderella man, Cinderella man, Cinderella man, Cinderella man)
Smash an hourglass, grab the sand, take his hands and cup 'em
Spit a rhyme to freeze the clock; take the hands of time and cuff 'em
(Cinderella man, Cinderella man, Cinderella man, Cinderella man)

There's a storm comin' that the weatherman couldn't predict
I start the bug prick, you better flea 'cause I get ticked
It's a wrap; I was down, when I was down I was kicked
I got up, I'm back to punch you to the ground, you're tricked

It's a trap; fuck my last CD, that shit's in my trash
I'll be goddamned if another rapper gets in my ass
I hit the gas and I spit every rap as if it's my last
You can die in the blink of an eye, so bat your eyelashes

And keep winkin' and blowin' kisses 'cause you're flirtin' with death
I'm destroyin' your livelihood, I ain't just hurtin' your rep
I catch a flow and get goin'; no remorse I'm showin', ain't slowin' for no one
Knowin' there's nothin' you can do about it

Zeroin' on my target like a marksman, the target is you
I shut your lane down, took your spot; parked in it, too
Arsenic flow, lighter fluid, saliva—what can you do?
Go get your crew to hype you up; stand behind you like, wooh

That boy's hot enough to melt hell, burn Satan, too
Fry his ass and put his ashes back together with glue
So you can hate him, he don't blame you; frankly, he would, too
This game could ill-afford to lose him; how 'bout you?

Now guess who (hey), here's a clue (hey)
He came to the ball in his wife beater, lost his Nike shoe
It's in your ass (hey), he's in your ass; he's all up in your psyche, too (hey)
Now, what's his name?

If I had a time machine, I'd be

Music is my time machine so call me

Fuck catchin' lightnin'; he struck it; screamed ""Shut up"" at thunder
Then flipped the world upside down and made it rain upward
(Cinderella man, Cinderella man, Cinderella man, Cinderella man)
Rewound the future to the present, paused it, don't ask how
Fuck the past, motherfucker; he's the shit right how
He's (Cinderella man, Cinderella man, Cinderella man, Cinderella man)

Cinderella man, Cinder-fella, Shady Dane
Came to wrap the game up in cellophane, raise hell; from hell he came
But didn't come to bore ya with the Cinderella story
Nor did he come to do the same ol'; can't afford to be a lame-o

In this day and age and at this stage of the game
Mediocrity can no longer be allowed to fly
So say bye to the old, H-I to the new, Que Sera
Consider it his last hurrah, the coup de grace; raise 'em high

In the sky, keep 'em out, time to bring the place alive
Thanks for bein' patient; I won't make no more mistakes, shit
My potatoes baked homie, the veggies on my plate can fly
My filet is smokin' weed; yeah, faggot, the stakes are high

Shit, I ain't even s'pposed to be here by the grace of God
The skin on my teeth and a hair on my nuts, I skated by
Now y'all are on thin ice with ankle weights, I'd hate to lie
How fuckin' irritated are you, how much in your face am I?

And ain't shit you can do but fear it; Proof is here in spirit
And I'm his spittin' image; I mirror it when I stand near it
Your pussy lyric, I cunt hear it
Who forms pyramids and raps circles around square lyricists?

Who (hey), here's a clue (hey)
He came to the ball in his wife beater, lost his Nike shoe
It's in your ass (hey), he's in your ass; he's all up in your psyche, too (hey)

Eminem,25 To Life,"Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life

Yeah, too late
I can't keep, chasing you
I'm taking my life back
Caught in a chase, 25 to life

I don't think she understands, the sacrifices that I've made
Maybe if this bitch had acted right, I would have stayed
But I've already wasted over half my life, I would have laid
Down and died for you, I no longer cry for you, no more pain

Bitch you, took me for granted took my heart and ran it
Straight into the planet, into the dirt I can no longer stand it
Now my respect I demand it, I'ma take control of this relationship command it
And I'ma be the boss of you now goddammit

And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me
So you better hear me out, this much you owe me
I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you I have stayed
Faithful all the way, this is how I fuckin' get repaid

Look at how I dress, fuckin' baggy sweats, go to work a mess
Always in a rush to get back to you, I ain't heard you yet
Not even once say you appreciate me, I deserve respect
I've done my best to give you nothin' less than perfectness

And I know that if I end this, I'll no longer have nothin' left
But you keep treatin' me like a staircase, it's time to fuckin' step
And I won't be comin' back, so don't hold your fuckin' breath
You know what you've done, no need to go in depth

I told you'd be sorry if I fuckin' left, I'd laugh while you wept
How's it feel now, yeah funny ain't it
You neglected me, did me a favor though my spirit free you've set
But a special place for you, in my heart I have kept, it's unfortunate but it's

Too late for the other side (yeah)
Caught in a chase, 25 to life (can't take no more, can't take no more)
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life

I feel like when I bend over  (too late) backwards for you, all you do is laugh
'Cause that ain't good enough, you expect me to fold myself in half
Till I snap, don't think I'm loyal, all I do is rap
How can I moonlight on the side, I have no life outside of that

Don't I give you enough of my time, you don't think so do you
Jealous when I spend time with the girls, why I'm married to you
Still man I don't know, but tonight I'm serving you with papers
I'm divorcin' you, go marry someone else and make 'em famous

And take away their freedom, like you did to me, treat 'em
Like you don't need 'em and they ain't worthy of you, feed 'em
The same shit that you made me eat, I'm movin' on forget you
Oh, now I'm special, I ain't feel special when I was with you

All I ever felt was dissed, helplessness, imprisoned by a selfish bitch
Chew me up and spit me out, I fell for this so many times, it's ridiculous
And still I stick with this, I'm sick of this
But in my sickness and addiction, you're addictive as they get

Evil as they come, vindictive as they make 'em
My friends keep askin' me, why I can't just walk away from 'em
I'm addicted to the pain the stress the drama, I'm drawn to shit
I guess I'm a mess, cursed and blessed

But this time I ain't changin' my mind, I'm climbin' out this abyss
You're screamin' as I walk out that I'll be missed
But when you spoke of people who meant the most to you, you left me off your list
Fuck you hip-hop, I'm leaving you, my life sentence is served bitch

And it's just
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life (I'm gone man)
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life

Too late
Caught in a chase, 25 to life"

I'm right back on 'em with the *rchick-rchick-chicka-chick*
I can't call it, same shit different toilet
Oh ya, got a nice ass darlin'

Can't wait to get you into my Benz, take you for a spin
What you mean we ain't fuckin', you take me for a friend
Lemme tell you the whole story of Shady's origin
You'll be sorry, if you slam my Mercedes door again

Now, it all started with my father
I musta got my pimpin' genes from him, the way he left my mama
I'm a rollin' stone just like him, word to Johnny Drama
Keep my entourage wit me, baby I make a promise

There ain't nobody as bomb as me, I'm calm as the breeze
I'm the bee's knees, his legs and his arms
I'm a superstar girl, I'm ready for you mama
Why you think the only thing I got on is my pajamas

So bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad

Work my way down, baby you can lay down on the table
But you may want to find something more stable
I told you I ain't foolin from the gate, this ain't the first day of April

But thank you for staying April, I'ma make you
Learn to appreciate me, differentiate me
From these phony little fishy and sissy fake G's
Skip over the huggie bear and all the kissy face please

Initiate phase three, missy now service me
Take another shot of Jager, shake it so nervously
Take your time baby, ooh you're the bomb baby
Ooh you're doing that even better than your mom lady

I told you I'm shady, you didn't listen now did ya
Relax woman, you know that I'm only kiddin' with ya
Got a twisted sense of humor, it's warped but I didn't hit ya
I think you're finally startin' to get the picture, I'm just

Just drop them panties to the floor, let's get the cam 'cordin', damn shortie

I can hold you in the mornin'
But in the evenin' I gotta go

'Cause I'm on to the next girl
And the next girl I kinda like, oh oh oh

So bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you've ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna want to fuck nobody else again

Eminem,Almost Famous,"Yeah, can't stop now
Maybe the last chance I get

You dream of trading places, I have been changing faces
You cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose
Wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenseless
There is too much to lose, you can not fill these shoes

I just wanna be famous but
Be careful what you wish for

I stuck my dick in this game like a rapist, they call me Slim Roethlisberger
I go berserker than a fed up post office worker
A murker wit a Mossberg, I'm pissed off, get murdered
Like someone took a ketchup squirter, squirted a frankfurter

For a gangster ya sure did shit your pants when you saw
That chainsaw get to waivin' like a terrible towel
How things turn around when his fangs come out, get your brains blown out
That's what I call blowin' your mind, when I cum back like nut on your spine
I'm the thumb tack that you slept on, son
Now here I come screamin' 'a tac' like I just stepped on one

Low on the totem till he showed em defiance, giant scrotum
He don't owe them bitches shit, his britches, he out-growed 'em
He's so out cold he's knocked out at the South Pole
And nobody fucks with him, rigor mortis and post mortem

He's dyin' of boredom, take your best rhymes, record 'em
To try and thwart em, he'll just take your punch lines and snort 'em
Shit stained drawers, you gon' fuck wit a guy who licks the blades of his chainsaws
While he dips em in P.F. Chang sauce

Games off homie, hang it up like some crank calls
You think im backin' down, you must be out of your dang skulls
I'm almost famous

You dream of trading places, I have been changing faces
You can not fill these shoes, there is too much to lose
Wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenseless
There is too much to lose, you can not fill these shoes

I just wanna be famous but
Be careful what you wish for

I'm back for revenge, I lost the battle, that ain't happenin' again
I'm at your throat like strep, I step, strapped with a pen
Metaphors wrote on my hand, some are just stored in my memory
Some are wrote on a napkin, I do what I have to to win

Pullin' out all stops, any who touch a mic prior's
Not even Austin Powers, how the fuck are they Mike Myers
And tell that psycho to pass the torch to the wacko
'Fore I take a shit in his jack-o-lantern and smash it on his porch

Now get off my dick, dick's too short of a word for my dick
Get off my anti-disestablishment-arianism, you prick
Don't call me the champ, call me the space shuttle destroyer
I just blew up the Challenger, matter fact I need a lawyer

I just laced my gloves wit enough plaster to make a cast
Beat his ass naked and peed in his corner like Vern Troyer
Y'all are Eminem backwards, your Meni Me's
See he's in a whole 'nother weight class, he's slugs, you're bb's

You're bean bag bullets, you're full of it, you were dissin' his CD's
Laughed at Infinite, now he's back like someone pissed in his Wheaties
No peace treaties, he's turned into a beast
His new Slim Shady EP's got the attention of the mighty D-R-E
He's almost famous

You dream of trading places, I have been changing faces
You can not fill these shoes, there is too much to lose
Wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenseless
There is too much to lose, you can not fill these shoes

I just wanna be famous but
Be careful what you wish for

Now there he goes in Dre's studio cuppin' his balls
Screamin' the wood off the panelin', cussin' the paint off the walls
Spewin' his hate to these haters, showin' no love for these broads
He ain't givin' 'em shit, he says he'll pinch a penny so hard

He'll leave a bruise on the bronze so dark you can see the mark when it scars
Till Abraham Lincoln is screamin' out awww
His metaphors and similes ain't similar to them, not at all
If they don't like it, they can all get fucked instead of suckin' him off

They can go get a belt or a necktie to hang themselves by
Like David Carradine, they can go fuck themselves and just die
And eat shit while they're at it, he's fuckin' had it, he's mad at the whole world
So go to Hell and build a snowman, girl

The bully's become bullied, if pussies get pushed then they better pull me
Take me back to ninth grade to school me
'Cause I ain't lookin' back, only forward, this whole spot, blow it
Who could have known he'd grow to be a poet and not know it

And while im being poetic, let me get historic
And raise the bar, higher than my opinion of these women's been lowered
So bare witness to some biblical shit, there's a cold wind blowin'
This world ain't gonna know what hit it, he did it, he made it
He's finally famous"
Eminem,Untitled,"Singing with Spoken 
(You don't own me, don't try to change me)
Nah man, not quite finished yet.

Girl I think you just mighta tried to pull a mo'fuckin' fast one I'm mad
You just hurt my goddamn feeling and that was the last one I had
Does this look like an arcade, tryin' to play games, see this saw blade
See the silhouette of a stalker in your walkway, better cooperate

Or get sauteed and rotisseried, while you're hog-tied
MC's get so quiet, you can hear a mo'fuckin' dog whistle when I walk by
Colt Seavers on a mule, stuntin' on that ass like the fuckin' Fall Guy
I don't gas my Mercedes after midnight, I treat it like a mogwai

'Cause it will turn into a gremlin and run over kids women and men
Vnnn-vnnn motor's so big, you can fit a midget in his engine
Bitch, give me them digits, why you cringin', not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin
Will I spend spend even ten cents on you since when

Do you think it's gonna cost me a pretty penny
Shit, if I think a penny's pretty, just imagine how beautiful a quarter is to me
Eenie-meenie-miney-mo, catch an Eskimo by his toe, while he's trying to roll a snowball
But don't make him lose his cool, if he hollers better let him go ya'll

'Cause...
(You don't own me, don't try to change me)
Now here we go, go, go

Get up baby get a move on, like a U-Haul, you can rack your brain like pool balls
You won't ever think of this shit, yeah honey you called?
Well here I come, Havoc on the beat, I wreak it, evil I see hear and speak it
Lady put your money on Shady, fuck that other weak shit

Put your eggs in the same basket, you can count every mo'fuckin' chicken 'fore it hatches
'Cause, you can bet your ass that we gon' get it crackin'
Like the Kraken and Titans when they're clashin', get your brains bashed in
So bad you gon' have Kurt Cobain askin' to autograph a bloodstained napkin

Unfashionable and 'bout as rational as a rash on a fag's asshole
Now let's take that line run it up the flag pole with Elton
See if he's cool with it, don't stand there and look stupid at
Me bitch, I ain't in the mood for this shit, get my dick, Google it

Till it pops up, ya'll are so motherfuckin' full of shit that you've stopped up
Me, I'm always shittin' diarrhea of the mouth, till your speakers crap out, *fart* Ohp what
Girl you got a hot butt like a lit cigarette, ""Chik-Chigarette""
But you won't get a hot fudge Sundae from me, so do not strut my way slut

Because...
(You don't own me, don't try to change me)
Now here we go, go, go

And now that I got your panties in a bunch, and your bowels in an uproar
I'ma show you why I came, so you stop askin' me what the fuck for
Now look you little slut cunt whore, I know you want more
Bitch it's time to put the math back in the Mathers, 'cause I'm a fuckin' problem, run boy

Every flow got it mastered, so every last word that you fuckin' fags heard
Comes straight from the fishes ass, yeah in other words I'm a bass-turd
Lookin' at me like I killed Kenny, gas in the tank yeah still plenty
No morals are instilled in me, so remorse I really don't feel any

Eat your heart out Hannibal, understandable why you're jealous, fuck an animal
I got cannibal magnetism, can't resist him now, can ya ho?
Shady I don't understand your flow, understand my flow, bitch I flow like Troy
Polamalu's hair boy, don't you dare try to follow or compare boy

I'm raw, you ain't even medium rare, stay the fuck outta my hair boy
You can look, you can stare point, but you can't touch, I'm too clairvoyant
I don't get it man is there a void, all this weak shit, what am I steroids
Well bitch I'm back, with some shit for that ass, and your trunk, elephant hemorrhoids

And remember boys...
(You don't own me, don't try to change me)
Now here we go, go, go

Thank you for coming out
Hope you enjoyed the show

Camila Cabello,Never Be the Same,"Something must've gone wrong in my brain
Got your chemicals all in my veins
Feeling all the highs, feeling all the pain
Let go on the wheel, it's the bullet lane
Now I'm seeing red, not thinking straight
Blurring all the lines, you intoxicate me

Just like nicotine, heroin, morphine
Suddenly, I'm a fiend and you're all I need
All I need, yeah, you're all I need

It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit, and you will know I'll never be the same
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit, and you will know I'll never ever, ever be the same
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same

Sneaking in L.A. when the lights are low
Off of one touch I could overdose
You said, ""stop playing it safe
Girl, I wanna see you lose control""

Just like nicotine, heroin, morphine
Suddenly, I'm a fiend and you're all I need
All I need, yeah, you're all I need

It's you, babe

You're in my blood, you're in my veins, you're in my head

Oh I'm saying it's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe

Charlie Puth,Some Type Of Love,"When I'm old and grown
I won't sleep alone, woah
Every single moment will be fading into you
That's some type of love
That's some type of love

And I won't sing the blues
'Cause all I need is you, woah
Every single question will be answered all by you
That's some type of love
That's some type of love

When the world's on fire we won't even move
There is no reason if I'm here with you
And when it's said and done I'll give me to you
That's some type of love
That's some type of love

When were old and gray
And our faces changed
There won't be a moment when my heart don't feel the same
That's some type of love
That's some type of love

And every story ends
But we could still pretend
Every single moment will be just as we had planned
It was some type of love
That's some type of love

When the world's on fire we won't even move
There is no reason if I'm here with you
And when it's said and done I'll give me to you
That's some type of love
That's some type of love

If I'm here with you
I'll give me to you baby
That's some type of love
That's some type of love

When the world's on fire we won't even move
There is no reason if I'm here with you
And when it's said and done I'll give me to you
That's some type of love

Calum Scott,You Are The Reason,"There goes my heart beating
'Cause you are the reason
I'm losing my sleep
Please come back now

There goes my mind racing
And you are the reason
That I'm still breathing
I'm hopeless now

I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, 'cause I need you to see
That you are the reason

There goes my hand shaking
And you are the reason
My heart keeps bleeding
I need you now

If I could turn back the clock
I'd make sure the light defeated the dark
I'd spend every hour, of every day
Keeping you safe

And I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, 'cause I need you to see

That you are the reason, oh
(I don't wanna fight no more)
(I don't wanna hide no more)
(I don't wanna cry no more)
(Come back, I need you to hold me) 
You are the reason, oh
(A little closer now)
(Just a little closer now) 
(Come a little closer now)
(I need you to hold me tonight)

I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken

Shawn Mendes,In My Blood,"Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood

Laying on the bathroom floor, feeling nothing
I'm overwhelmed and insecure, give me something
I could take to ease my mind slowly
Just have a drink and you'll feel better
Just take her home and you'll feel better
Keep telling me that it gets better
Does it ever?

Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me
I'm crawling in my skin
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood

It isn't in my blood

Looking through my phone again feeling anxious
Afraid to be alone again, I hate this
I'm trying to find a way to chill, can't breathe, oh
Is there somebody who could...

Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me
I'm crawling in my skin
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood

It isn't in my blood

I need somebody now
I need somebody now
Someone to help me out
I need somebody now

Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up

Yeah, I bet you're bending God's ear talking 'bout me.
You're trying not to let the first tear fall out
Trying not to think about turning around
You're trying not to get lost in the sound but that song is always on

Stuck thinking 'bout it driving on the freeway
Wondering if I really tried everything I could
Not knowing if I should try a little harder

Oh, but I'm scared to death
That there may not be another one like this
And I confess that I'm only holding on by a thin thin thread
I'm kicking the curb cause you never heard
The words that you needed so bad
And I'm kicking the dirt 'cause I never gave you
The things that you needed to have

I'm so sad, sad

Man, it's been a long night
Just sitting here, trying not to look back
Still looking at the road we never drove on
And wondering if the one I chose was the right one

Oh, but I'm scared to death
That there may not be another one like this
And I confess that I'm only holding on by a thin thin thread
I'm kicking the curb cause you never heard
The words that you needed so bad

Charlie Puth,Patient,"These mistakes I made my fair share
When you needed me, I wasn't there
I was young, I was dumb, I was so immature
And the things that I did made you so insecure
But baby I'm still your man I swear

Please be patient with me
Please be patient with me
I know I'm not what you need
But baby I'm gonna be
So please be patient with me

Is it too much that I'm asking for
Can we start over, can we end this war
I've been taking your love, I've been wasting your time
But is there still a chance of me changing your mind
Before you go walking out the door

Oh you know I'm not perfect
If you leave I deserve it
But baby all I'm asking you is please, please

Please be patient with me
Please be patient with me
I know I'm not what you need
But baby I'm gonna be
So please be patient with me

Oh you don't wanna wait another minute
You don't wanna wait another night
Just trust me, just trust me
Just trust me baby
You don't wanna wait another minute
No, you don't wanna wait another night

Executive deals online, limited amount of time
Chasin' these dollar signs and you ain't on your grind
You might be able to find me up in the MGM casino in the D
Fuckin' off fetti I coulda put on property
From the Bay to the Murder Mitten, my niggas put murder missions
She choose him, that's her decision, free my niggas in prison
On the phone with a bitch who can't do shit
For a pimp but make a nigga hella rich
Got a blunt in my dental, goin' H.A.M in a rental
On my way, to Sacramento, late night, Arsenio
I'm never sentimental, go hard or go home, listen
Barely Harley, I'm chromeless, you might end up domeless
I bet you she into me, her cheddar, she givin' me
I make a bitch stand outside forever like the Statue of Liberty
Rest in pimp, Pimp C, underground king of the South
I raise my Styrofoam up, and pour some drank in my mouth
Why you always coming around with bad news?
Say you want me to win, but hope I lose
Ass never rock with other niggas in the crew

I swear I hear some new bullshit every day I'm wakin' up
It seems like nowadays everybody breakin' up
That shit can break you down if you lose a good girl
I guess you need a bad bitch to come around and make it up
I guess drama makes for the best content
Everything got a bad side, even a conscience
Now you're drinkin' till your unconscious
Feel me when you get a fine bitch
Just don't forget to read the fine print
Life got me meditatin' like I'm in the Himalayas
Keep it G with the L lit on me like the elevator
Yeah I know that karma's too real so I hope you doin' cool

Little stupid ass I ain't fuckin' with

Post Malone,Better Now,"You probably think that you are better now, better now

I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around

I did not believe that it would end, no
Everything came second to the Benzo
You're not even speakin' to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget
But I can't get this shit outta my head

I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything

I seen you with your other dude
He seemed like he was pretty cool
I was so broken over you
Life it goes on, what can you do?
I just wonder what it's gonna take
Another foreign or a bigger chain
Because no matter how my life has changed
I keep on looking back on better days

You probably think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around

I swear to you, I'll be okay

Carpenters,Top Of The World,"Such a feeling's coming over me
There is wonder in most everything I see
Not a cloud in the sky
Got the sun in my eyes
And I won't be surprised if it's a dream

Everything I want the world to be
Is now coming true especially for me
And the reason is clear
It's because you are here
You're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen

I'm on the top of the world
Looking down on creation
And the only explanation I can find
Is the love that I've found
Ever since you've been around
Your love's put me at the top of the world?

Something in the wind has learned my name
And it's telling me that things are not the same
In the leaves on the trees
And the touch of the breeze
There's a pleasing sense of happiness for me

There is only one wish on my mind
When this day is through I hope that I will find
That tomorrow will be
Just the same for you and me
All I need will be mine if you are here

I'm on the top of the world
Looking down on creation
And the only explanation I can find
Is the love that I've found
Ever since you've been around
Your love's put me at the top of the world?

I've cried too many tears, yeah, writing this song
Trying to fit in, where do I belong?
I wake up every day, don't want to leave my home
My momma's askin' me why I'm always alone
Too scared to say, too scared to holler
I'm walking to school, with sweat around my collar
I'm just a kid, I don't want no stress
My nerves are bad, my life's a mess
The names you call me, they hurt real bad
I want to tell my Mom
But she's havin' trouble with my Dad
I feel so trapped there's nowhere to turn
Come to school
Don't wanna fight I wanna learn
So please mister Bully
Tell me what I've done

I'm livin' with my Mom

I know it ain't easy, but, that's okay
Just be hopeful

Why do you trip but the colour on my skin?
Or whether I'm fat or whether I'm thin?
You call me a loser, you call me a fool
I ain't got a choice, I gotta go to school
I wish I had an angel to stand by my side
I'm shaking with fear, I'm so scared inside
Does it really matter if I ain't got the looks?
Why do you always hurt me and destroy my hooks?

'Cause I'm hopeful, yes I am

Take this music and use it
Let it take you away
And be hopeful, hopeful
And He'll make a way
I know it ain't easy, but, that's okay
Just be hopeful

I give you all my money every single day
I didn't ask to be born but now I have to pay
I ain't got no food, you take all I have
When I give it to you, you searchin' my bags
I wrote this song for you to see
We could've been friends, yeah, you and me
Mister Bully take a moment please
Every single day you bring me to my knees

'Cause I'm hopeful, yes I am
Hopeful for today
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away

And He'll make a way
I know it ain't easy, but, that's okay

OneRepublic,Connection,"These days my waves get lost in the oceans
Seven billion swimmers, man I'm going through the motions
Sent up a flare, I need love and devotion
Traded for some faces that I never know, notion
Maybe I should try to find the old me
Take me to the places and the people that know me
Tryna disconnect, thinking maybe you could show me
If there's so many people here, why am I so lonely?

Can I get a connection?
Can I get, can I get a connection?
Can I get a connection?
Can I get, can I get a connection?

Good friends, good friends hard to find, let's face it
Bought the perfect home and there's a flood in the basement
Made a couple dollars now and I ain't tryna chase it
Kids from Oklahoma, man we don't waste it
I'm just tryna paint the picture for me
Something I could give a damn about at maybe 40
Years and I'll be ready and willing, be able to edit the story
'Cause there's so many people here to be so damn lonely

Can I get a connection?
Can I get, can I get a connection?
Can I get a connection?
Can I get, can I get a connection?
I can see it in my, see it in my reflection
Oh, can I get a connection?
Can I get, can I get a connection?

Lonely

Right now, right now, I'm switching to a new lane
Foot to the floor, I'm searching for the real thing
Met somebody else, sometimes ain't no shame
Head to the clouds sayin'

It's like can I get a connection?
Can I get, can I get a connection?
Can I get a connection?
Can I get, can I get a connection?

If I had a diamond heart

I don't know if this is right or wrong
Am I giving up where I belong?

The giant's woke, eyes open, undeniable
Supplyin' smoke, got the fire stoked

I say one call to Interscope and you're Swayze
Your reply got the crowd yelling, ""Woo""

With your corny lines (Slim, you're old)
Ow, Kelly, ooh, but I'm 45 and I'm still outselling you
By 29 I had three albums that had blew
Now let's talk about somethin' I don't really do
Go in someone's daughter's mouth stealin' food
But you're a fuckin' mole hill, now I'ma make a mountain out of you, woo!
Ho, chill, actin' like you put the chrome barrel to my bone marrow
Gunner? bitch, you ain't a bow and arrow
Say you'll run up on me like a phone bill, sprayin' lead
Playin' dead, that's the only time you hold still
Are you eating cereal... or oatmeal?
What the fuck's in the bowl, milk? Wheaties or Cheerios?
'Cause I'm takin' a shit in 'em, Kelly, I need reading material
...Dictionary...
Yo Slim, your last four albums sucked
Go back to Recovery, oh shoot, that was three albums ago
What do you know? Oops, know your facts before you come at me, lil' goof
Luxury, oh, you broke, bitch?
Yeah, I had enough money in '02
To burn it in front of you, ho
Younger me? No, you're the whack me
It's funny, but so true
I'd rather be 80-year-old me than 20-year-old you
Till I'm getting old-aged still can fill a whole page with a 10 year old's rage
Got more fans than you in your own city, lil' kiddy
Go play, feel like I'm babysitting Lil Tay
Got the Diddy okay so you spent your whole day
Shootin' a video just to fuckin' dig your own grave
Got you at your own wake, I'm the billy goat
You ain't never made a list next to no Biggie, no Jay
Next to Taylor Swift, and that Iggy hoe, you about to really blow
Kelly, they'll be putting your name
Next to Ja, next to Benzino, die, motherfucker
Like the last motherfucker sayin' Hailie in vain
Alien brain, you Satanist (yeah)
My biggest flops are your greatest hits
The game's mine again and ain't nothin' changed but the locks
So before I slay this bitch, mwah, give Jade a kiss
Gotta wake up Labor Day to this (the fuck?)
Bein' rich, aimed by some prick usin' my name for clickbait
In a state of bliss 'cause I said his goddamn name
Now I gotta cock back, aim, yeah, bitch, pop champagne to this
It's your moment, this is it
As big as you're gonna get, so enjoy it
Had to give you a career to destroy it
Lethal injection, go to sleep six feet deep
I'll give you a B for the effort, but if I was three
Foot 11, you'd look up to me, and for the record
You would suck a dick to fuckin' be me for a second
Lick a ballsack to get on my channel
Give your life to be as solidified
This motherfuckin' shit is like Rambo when he's out of bullets
So what good is a fuckin' machine gun when it's out of ammo?
Had enough of this tatted-up mumble rapper
How the fuck can him and I battle?
He'll have to fuck Kim in my flannel
I'll give him my sandals
'Cause he knows long as I'm Shady, he's gon' have to live in my shadow
Exhausting, letting off on my offspring
Like a gun barrel, bitch, get off me
You dance around it like a sombrero, we can all see
You're fuckin' salty 'cause Young Gerald's balls-deep inside of Halsey
Your red sweater, your black leather
You dress better, I rap better
That a death threat or a love letter?
Little white toothpick
Thinks it's over a pic, I just don't like you, prick
Thanks for dissing me
Now I had an excuse on the mic to write Not Alike
But really, I don't care who's in the right
But you're losin' the fight you picked
Who else want it, Kells?
Attempt fails, Budden, L's
Fuckin' nails in these coffins as soft as Cottonelle
Killshot, I will not fail, I'm with the Doc still
But this idiot's boss pops pills and tells him he's got skills
But Kells, the day you put out a hit's the day Diddy admits
That he put the hit out that got Pac killed, ah
I'm sick of you bein' whack
And still usin' that motherfuckin' AutoTune, so let's talk about it (let's talk about it)
I'm sick of your mumble rap mouth
Need to get the cock up out it before we can even talk about it (talk about it)
I'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings
Just 'cause you look in the mirror and think you're Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
Don't mean you are, and you're not about it
So just leave my dick in your mouth, and keep my daughter out it

You fuckin'... oh
And I'm just playin', Diddy, you know I love you"
Lady Gaga,Is That Alright?,"Life is so simple
A little boy a little girl
Laughing and loving
Tryin' to figure out the world
It felt like summer when I kissed you in the rain
And I know your story but tell me again
Nothing you say wouldn't interest me
All of your words are like poems to me
I would be honored if you would take me as I am

I want you
To look right in my eyes
To tell me you love me
To be by my side
I want you
At the end of my life
Wanna see your face
When I fall with grace
At the moment I die
Is that alright?
Is that alright?

I hope you're still with me
When I'm not quite myself
And I pray that you'll lift me
When you know I need help
It's a warm celebration of all of our years
I dream of our story of our fairytale
Family dinners and family trees
Teachin' the kids to say thank you and please
Knowing if we stay together that things will be right

I want you
To look right in my eyes
To tell me you love me
To be by my side
I want you
At the end of my life
Wanna see your face
When I fall with grace
At the moment I die
Is that alright?
Is that alright?
Is that alright?"
Blue Stahli,Corner,"Feel me in the corner, oh, beside your mouth
Feel me in the inside of the faintest trace of sound
It's fire underwater, breathing while you drown
Feel me in the saturation when the sun burns out

'Cause I am the one inside you
And I am the one (Inside your veins)
'Cause I am the one inside you
Over and over I'm here again

Far beyond the bruising, something underneath
Feel me in the aftermath when you learn the world has teeth

'Cause I am the one inside you
And I am the one (Inside your veins)
'Cause I am the one inside you
Over and over I'm here again

There is so much more to this than
Phantom limbs for amputees
Here, dissolving through the trauma
This is where you'll feel the breath of me

(I am the one inside you)
And I am the one (Inside your veins)
'Cause I am the one inside you
Over and over I'm here again

'Cause I am the one inside you
And I am the one (Inside your veins)
'Cause I am the one inside you
Over and over I'm here again

Here again"

Eminem,Cold Wind Blows,"'Cause some things just, don't change
It's better when they stay the same
Although the whole world knows your name
So on a, bigger stage they came to see you spit your game, oh
But it shouldn't be difficult, to explain
Just why you came back again, you hate the fame
Love the game, cold as ice, you remain
Fuck 'em all, tell 'em all, eat shit, here we go again

Spoken:
So, goddamn.
Is it that time again already?
Haha, y'all don't look too happy to see me.
Fuck man, don't everybody welcome me back at once?
All right, fuck y'all then.

You can get the dick, just call me the ball sac, I'm nuts
Michael Vick in this bitch dog, fall back, you mutts
Fuck your worms, you've never seen such a sick puppy
Fuck it a sick duck, I want my duck-sicked, mommy
And my nuts licked, gobble 'em up trick, yummy
Bitch, you don't fuckin' think I know that you suck dick, dummy
You'll get your butt kicked, fuck all that love shit, honey
Yeah I laugh when I call you a slut, it's funny
Shorty, dance while I diss you to the beat, fuck the words
You don't listen to 'em anyway, yeah struck a nerve sucka
Motherfucka' might as well let my lips pucker
Like Elton John, 'cause I'm just a mean cock-sucker
This shit is on 'cause you went and pissed me off, now I'm shittin' and pissin' on
Everybody, give a fuck if it's right or wrong
So buck the Buddah, light a bong
But take a look at Mariah next time I inspire you to write a song (Come on)

Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh oh
I'm as cold as the cold wind, blows
When it snows, and it's twenty be-low
Ask me why, man I just don't, know
Kno-kno-know, know-know know
I'm as cold as the cold wind, blows
Blo-blo-blows, blow-blow blows
Oh oh-oh

Fuck it, I'm a loose cannon
Bruce Banner's back in the booth, y'all are sittin' ducks, I'm the only goose standin'
I'll set the world on fire, piss on it put it out
Stick my dick in a circle, but I'm not fuckin' around
Mo'fucker, I'll show you pussyfootin'
I'll kick a bitch in the cunt, 'til it makes a queef, and sounds like a fuckin' whoopee cushion
Who the fuck is you pushin', you must have mistook me for some
Sissy soft punk, lookin' for some nookie or bosom
Go ahead fuckin' hater push me, I told you ain't no fuckin' way to shush me
Call me a faggot, 'cause I hate a pussy
Man the fuck up sissy, G's up, all you gardeners freeze up
Put your hoes down, Shady ease up
Man chill, naw I can't goddammit, rap is a landfill
Drop the anvil, these are shoes that you can't fill
Shit the day that happens, the world will
Stop spinnin' and Michael J. Fox'll, come to a stand-still

Durin' an earthquake, urine in your face 'cause you're fake
Ow what the fuck, that hurt, wait
Ow what the fuck, I just got struck
By lightnin', alright then I quit, God I give up
Call it evil that men do, Lord forgive me for what my pen do
This is for your sins, I cleanse you
You can repent but I warn you, if you continue
To Hell I'll send you, and just then the wind blew, and I said...

Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh oh

I'm as cold as the cold wind, blows
Blo-blo-blows, blow-blow blows
Oh oh-oh oh-oh

How long will I be this way, Shady until my dyin' day
'Til I hang up the mic and it's time for me to say
So long, 'til then I'll drop the fuckin' bombs
Like I missed the pass when I went long
If you don't like it you can kiss my ass in a lint thong
Now sing along, slut this, slut that, learn the words to the song
Oh bitches don't like that, homie I'll be nicer to women
When Aquaman drowns and the Human Torch starts swimmin'
Man I'm a, cold soul, I roll solo so don't compare
Me, to them other bums over there
It's like apples to oranges, peaches to plums, yeah
I'm bananas pussy, cut off the grapes and grow a pair
But I swear, you try to dis me I'll slaughter you
I put that on everything, like everyone does with auto-tune
The last thing you wanna do is have me spit out a rhyme
And say I was writin' this and I thought of you, so...

Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh oh
I'm as cold as the cold wind, blows
When it snows, and it's twenty be-low
Ask me why, man I just don't...

I don't know... I don't know what caused...
I don't know what caused me to be this way
I don't know... I don't know but I'll...
Probably be this way 'til my dyin' day
I don't know why I'm so... I'm so cold
Mean things I don't mean to say
I guess this is how you made me"
Eminem,On Fire,"Heh, yeah, haha
You know critics man, critics never got nothing nice to say man
You know the one thing I noticed about critics, man
Is critics never asked me how my day went
Well, I'ma tell 'em

Yesterday my dog died, I hog tied a ho, tied her in a bow
Said next time you blog, try to spit a flow
You wanna criticize dog, try a little mo'
I'm so tired of this, I could blow, fire in the hole

I'm fired up so fire up the lighter and the dro
Better hold on a little tighter, here I go
Flow's tighter, hot headed as ghost rider, cold hearted
As Spider-Man throwin' a spider in the snow

So you better get lower than Flo-Rida inside of a low-rider
With no tires in the hole
Why am I like this, why is winter cold
Why is it when I talk, I'm so biased to the ho's

Listen dog, Christmas is off, this is as soft as it gets
This isn't golf, this is a blisterin' assault
Those are your wounds, this is the salt
So get lost, shit, dissin' me is just like pissin' off

The Wizard of Oz, wrap a lizard in gauze
Beat you in the jaws with it, grab the scissors and saws
And cut out your livers, gizzards and balls
Throw you in the middle of the ocean in a blizzard with Jaws

So sip piss like sizzurp through a straw
Then describe how it tasted like dessert to us all
Got the gall to make Chris piss in his drawers
Tickle him, go to his grave, skip him and visit his dog

You're on fire
That's how you know you're on a roll
'Cause when you're hot, it's like you're burning up, everyone else is cold
You're on fire
Man, I'm so fuckin' sick
I got ambulances pullin' me over and shit

You're on fire
You need to stop, drop and roll
'Cause when you say the shit to get the whole Hip-Hop shop to blow
You're on fire, yeah, you're on fire

I just put a bullshit hook
In between two long ass verses, if you mistook this for a song, look
This ain't a song, it's a warnin' to Brooke
Hogan and David Cook, that the crook just took over, so book

Run as fast as you can, stop writing and kill it
I'm lightnin' in a skillet, you're a fuckin' flash in the pan
I pop up, you bitches scatter
Like hot grease splashin' a fan, Mr. Mathers is the man

Yeah, I'm pissed but I would rather take this energy and stash it in a can
Come back and whip your ass with it again
Saliva's like sulfuric acid in your hand
It'll eat through anything, metal, the ass of Iron Man

Turn him into plastic, so for you to think that you could stand
A fuckin' chance is asinine, yeah ask Denaun, man
Hit a blind man with a coloring book and told him color inside the lines
Or get hit with a flying crayon

Fuck it, I ain't playin'
Pull up in a van and hop out on a homeless man holdin' a sign sayin'
Vietnam Vet, I'm out my fuckin' mind, man
Kick over the can, beat his ass and leave him nine grand

So if I seem a little mean to you
This ain't savage, you ain't never seen a brute
You wanna get graphic, we can go the scenic route
You couldn't make a bulimic puke on a piece of fuckin' corn and peanut poop

Sayin' you sick, quit playin' you prick, don't nobody care
And why the fuck am I yellin' at air
I ain't even talkin' to no one 'cause ain't nobody there
Nobody'll fuckin' test me 'cause these ho's won't even dare

I'm wastin' punch lines but I got so many to spare
I just thought of another one that might go here
Naw, don't waste it, save it psycho, yeah
Plus you gotta rewrite those lines that you said about Michael's hair

You're on fire
That's how you know you're on a roll
'Cause when you're hot, it's like you're burning up, everyone else is cold
You're on fire
Man, I'm so, im so hot
My muthafuckin' fire truck's on fire, homie

Girl forget remorse, I'ma hit you broads with Chris' force like you pissed him off

Talented with the tongue, mo'fucker you ain't got a lick in yours
Hittin' licks like I'm robbin' liquor stores, makin' cash registers shit their drawers
Think you spit the rawest, I'm an uncooked slab of beef layin' on your kitchen floor

You're addicted, I'm dope, I'm the longest needle around here, need a fix up
I'm the big shot, get it, dick snots, you're just small pokes, little pricks (ha)

Does Lil Wayne slurp syrup till he burps and smoke purp, does a word search
Gettin' circles wrapped around it like you do when I come through, I'd like you to
Remind yourself of what the fuck I can do when I'm on the mic, girl, you're the kind of girl that I can take a likin' to

Psych, I'm spikin' you like a football, been this way since I stood a foot tall
You're a good catch with a shitty spouse, got a pretty mouth and a good jaw
Give me good brain, watch the wood grain, don't want no cum stain, bitch you listening
Tryin' to turn me down, slut I'm talkin' to you, turn me back up, are you insane?

Tryin' to talk over me in the car, shut the fuck up while my shit's playing
I'm a shit stain on the underwear of life, what's the saying, where there's thunder, there's lightning
And they say that it never stikes twice in the same place
Then how the fuck have I been hit six times in three different locations on four separate occasions

And you can bet your stinkin' ass that I've come to smash everything in my path
Fork was in the road, took the psycho path, poison ivy wouldn't have me thinkin' rash
So hit the dance floor, cutie, while I do my duty on this microphone, shake your booty

Better watch out now 'cause here we come
And we ain't stoppin' until we see the mornin' sun
So give us room to do our thing 'cause we ain't come to hurt no one
So everybody come and get up on the floor now and grab someone

Man first of all I'm a boss, I just wanna get that across
Man, even my dentist hates when I floss
Pull up to the club in a Pinto like it's a Porsche
Garbage bag for one of the windows, spray-painted doors

With the flames on 'em, Michigan plates and my name's on 'em
Baby, Shady's here, come and get him if you dames want him
But he ain't stupid so quit tryin' to run them games on him
He's immune to Cupid, why you tryin' to put your claims on him

'Cause you won't do to me what you did to the last man
Now climb in back, try not to kick over the gas can
There's a half a gallon in it, that could be our last chance
We have of just gettin' home, now can I get that lap dance

She's got a tattoo of me right above her ass, man
In the streets of Warren, Michigan, we call em tramp stamps
That means she belongs to me, time to put the damn clamps
Down and show this hussy who's the man, now get amped, dance

Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nuttin but a white trash party (white trash party)

So let's have us a little bash
And if anyone asks, it ain't no one but us trash
You don't know, ya better ask somebody
'Cause we're havin' a white trash party (white trash party)

Pull a 5th of Bacardi from out of my underwear
And walk around the party without a care like a body without a head
Lookin' like a zombie from Night of the Livin' Dead
And tomorrow probably still be too high to get out of bed

Till I feel like I've been hit with the sharp part of the hammer
Mixin' Hennessy and Fanta with Pepto and Mylanta
I shoot the gift like im hollerin', ""Die Santa!""
Missed the tree and hit Rudolf and 2 innocent bystanders

So quit tryin' to play the Wall like you're Paul and
Get on the floor when the beat drops and stop stallin'
They call me the Stephon Marbury of rap darlin'
'Cause as soon as they throw on some R. Kelly, I start ballin'

Makin' it rain for the ladies in the Mini's
But im not throwin' ones, five, tens or even twenties
I'm throwin' quarters, nickels, dimes, pennies up at Skinny's
Man, I do this for them bunnies up at Denny's

From the north, east and west but when it comes to them trailers in them Southparks
Muffle it 'cause homie that hood's tighter than Kenny's
So ladies, if your belly button's not an innie then im outtie
Now hop in my mini-van, let's get rowdy, come on

Now you can do this on your own

Now whether your black, white or purple, if you're misunderstood
But you don't give a fuck, you ain't doin' shit that you should
Long as you know your up to evil and your no damn good
Get on the floor, man and rep yo hood

Now, honey, don't let them pricks trip, we should make a quick dip
And go do some donuts in the hospital parkin' lot 'cause, girl, I got a sick whip
Kick the back window out of my Gremlin, put two milk crates in the trunk
Rip out the stick shift and make a five seater
I'll be damned if I feed a chick, it ain't like me to split a piece of dry pita
I be the S-L to the I-M to the S-H-A-D-Y and I don't need a tank top to be a wife beater

I'll rip a tree out the ground and flip it upside down
'Fore I turn over a new leaf, clown
I'll tell ya now, I'm so raw, I still need to un-thaw
You feel me y'all, I'll shut the club down like Drake in the mall

But, baby, a body like that's against the law
You the baddest little chain with the blades I ever saw
Coleslaw containers, empty straw wrappers and all
You got more junk in your trunk than I do in my car, now get up

Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nuttin but a white trash party (white trash party)

I'm going through changes

Lately I really, feel like, I'm rollin' for Delph like Philly
Feel like I'm losin' control of myself, I sincerely
Apologize if all that I sound like is I'm complainin'
But life keeps on complicatin'

And I'm debatin' on, leavin' this world this evenin'
Even my girls can see I'm grievin', I try and hide it
But I can't, why do I act like I'm all high and mighty
When inside I'm dyin', I am finally realizin' I need

Help, can't do it myself, too weak
Two weeks I've been havin' ups and downs, goin' through peaks
And valleys, dilly dallyin', 'round with the idea
Of endin' this shit right here

I'm hatin' my reflection, I walk around the house tryin' to fight in mirrors
I can't stand what I look like yeah
I look fat but what do I care, I give a fuck
Only thing I fear is Hailie, I'm afraid if I close my eyes then I might see her
Shit

I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes

I lock myself in the bedroom, bathroom, nappin' at noon
Yeah dad's in a bad mood, he's always snappin' at you
Marshall what happened that you can't stop with these pills
And you've fallen off with your skills and your own fans are laughin' at you

You've become a problem you're too pussy to tackle, get up
Be a man, stand, a real man would have had this shit handled
Know you just had your heart ripped out and crushed
They say Proof just flipped out, homie just whipped out and bust

Nah, it ain't like Doody to do that
He wouldn't fuckin' shoot at nobody, he'd fight first
But dwellin' on it only makes the night worse
Now I'm poppin' Vic's, Perc's and Methadone pills
Yeah Em, tight verse, you killed it

Fuckin' drug dealers hang around me like yes men
And they gon' do whatever I says when, I says it
It's in their best interest to protect their investment
And I just lost my fuckin', best friend, so fuck it I guess then

I'm going through changes
Don't know what I'm gonna do
But I just keep on going through changes
I'm going through changes

My friends just can't understand this new me
That's understandable man, but think how bananas you'd be
You'd be an animal too, if you were trapped in this fame and caged in it like a zoo
And everybody's lookin' at you, what you want me to do

I'm startin' to live like a recluse and the truth is
Fame's startin' to give me an excuse to be at a all time low
I sit alone in my home theater, watchin' the same damn DVD

Of the first tour, the last tour, he was still alive
And it hurt, so I fast forward, sleepin' pills will make me feel alright
And if I'm still awake in the middle of the night
I just take a couple more, yeah you're motherfuckin' right

I ain't slowin' down for no one, I am almost homeward bound
Almost in a coma, yeah homie come on dole 'em out
Daddy don't you die on me, daddy better hold your ground
Fuck, don't I know the sound of that voice, yeah baby hold me down

(Daddy)
I'm going through changes
(Daddy)
Don't know what I'm gonna do
But I just keep on going through changes
I'm going through changes

Wake up in the hospital, full of tubes, but somehow I'm pullin' through
Swear when I come back, I'ma be bulletproof
I'ma do it just for Proof, I think I should state a few
Facts, 'cause I may not get a chance again to say the truth

Shit, it just hit me that what if I would not have made it through
I think about the things I would never got to say to you
I'd never get to make it right, so here's what I came to do
Hailie this one is for you, Whitney and Alaina too

I still love your mother, that'll never change, think about her every day
We just could never get it together hey, wish there was a better way
For me to say it, but I swear on everything
I'd do anything for her, on any day

There are just too many things to explain, when it rains
Guess it pours, yes it does, wish there wasn't any pain
But I can't pretend there ain't, I ain't placin' any blame
I ain't pointin' fingers, heaven knows I never been a saint

I know that it feels like we just pissed away our history
And just today, I looked at your picture almost if to say
I miss you subconsciously, wish it didn't end this way
But I just had to get away, don't know why, I don't know what else to say

I guess I'm I'm going through changes
Don't know what I'm gonna do
But I just keep on going through changes
I'm going through changes"
Eminem,Not Afraid,"I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid) (Yeah) to take a stand (to take a stand) (It's been a ride)
Everybody (I guess I had to) (everybody), come take my hand (Go to that place) (come take my hand) (To get to this one)
We'll walk this road together (Now some of you) through the storm
Whatever weather (Might still be in that place) cold or warm (If you're tryin to get out)
Just lettin' you know that, you're not alone (Just follow me)
Holla if you feel like (I'll get you there) you've been down the same road

You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper, before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words, before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin' I do it, I don't give a damn

What you think, I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world feed it beans
It's gassed up, if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who looked down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony

No if ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album, he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him

Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a ""fuck you"" for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the earth, he's got the urge
To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid) to take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody), come take my hand (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

OK quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm, for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth, for that
Fuck your feelin's, instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped

And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact
Let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was eh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground

Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack-bloww
'Cause I ain't playin' around, there's a game called circle
And I don't know how, I'm way too up to back down

But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud
Still follows me around, but it's time to exorcise these demons
These motherfuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid) to take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody), come take my hand (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like, you've been down the same road

And I just can't keep livin' this way
So startin' today, I'm breakin' out of this cage
I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, believe me you

I been through the ringer, but they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead, no more beef flingers

No more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it

'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
'Cause I'm raisin' the bar, I shoot for the moon
But I'm too busy gazin' at stars, I feel amazin' and I'm not

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid) to take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody), come take my hand (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like, you've been down the same road"
Eminem,Seduction,"Spoken:
I don't know, man. Just feels like, we're a lot different.
Kinda feels like, I'm on a hole different page, right now.
Feels strange, but um, I guess it's kinda like, it's kinda like...

I feel like I'm morphin'
Into somethin' that's so incredible that I'm dwarfin'
All competitors, better get your girlfriend in check
It's psychological warfare, endorphins I effect

Your self-esteem shatters as dialect, comes blastin' out your deck
She loves me, so much passion you'd expect
This sort of reaction from her yet
You strong arm, you're fuckin' corny, you try to turn your charm on
'Cause you just think you're Bishop The Don Juan

But if you think that you're fuckin' with me, homie, you're on one
I'm cockin' my head back like Ed Lover, come on son
She's on my Johnson, she brings my name up constant
Your boys are like she's fuckin' with dude, she wants son

Homeboy you better get a clue
She's on my dick 'cause I spit better than you
What you expect her to do, how you expect her to act in the sack
When she's closin' her eyes
Fantasizin' of diggin' her nails in my back to this track

Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody whose as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you

Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody whose as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you

She's sittin' here gettin' liquored up at the bar
She says it's quicker to count the things that ain't wrong with you than to count the things that are
There's a seven disc CD changer in her car
And I'm in every single slot and your not, aww

I'm the logo on that Dallas Cowboy helmet, a star
And I'm not about to sit back and just keep rhymin' one syllable, naw
Switch it up and watch them haters not give it up
'Cause they're just not good enough but I'm not givin' up, till I get my respect

And I won't stop till I get enough 'cause I'm not livin' up to my own expectations
Aww, that hater alarm is soundin' off, man, Obama took the bomb from my name, aww
So quit cryin' that I took your dame homie, she's my dame, aww
You sadly mistaken if you're thinkin' that I'm not on my game, boy

And things just ain't been the same since the day that I came forth
You wear your heart on your sleeve, I sport that white tank boy
But you got a hard on for me, what you hollerin' my name for
It's your bitch on my dick, ain't my dang fault, man, I can't call it

Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody whose as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you

Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody whose as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you

It's like we're playin' lyrical tug-of-war with your ear, you hear it, girl come here
Put your ear up to the speaker, dear, while I freak this world premier
Seducin' her, loosen up with a little freestyle, that'll wait, am I losin' ya
Am I makin' you look bad, well I got news for ya, homie you're losin' her

Oh wait, you don't like when I spit it fast, am I tryin' to show out, let me slow it down some
It's still gonna be a blow out, you're gonna wanna throw out your whole album
Rummage through the shit and try to salvage somethin' to see
If you can save any of it punk but none of it's fuckin' with me

Prick, you really feelin' that bullshit, you think you killin' them syllables
Quit playin', these beats ain't nuttin to fool with
They call me Fire Marshall, I shut this shit down
Your entire arsenal is not enough to fuck with one round

I am also the opposite of what you are like
You're a microcosm of what the fuck I am on the mic
I am awesome and you are just awe struck, she's love stricken
She's got her jaw struck from suckin' my dick, aww fuck

Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody whose as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you

Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody whose as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you"
Eminem,No Love,"Lil Wayne
Throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
But it's Fuck the world, get a child out her
Yeah my life a bitch, but you know nothin' bout her
Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers

I'm rollin' Sweets, I'm smokin' sour
Married to the game, but she broke her vows
That's why my bars are full of broken bottles
And my night stands are full of open Bibles, uh

I think about more than I forget
But I don't go around fire, expectin' not to sweat
And these niggas know I lay 'em down, make your bed
Bitches try to kick me while I'm down, I'll break your leg

Money outweighin', problems on the triple beam
I'm stickin' to the script, you nigga's skippin' scenes
Uh, be good or be good at it
Fuckin' right I've got my gun, semi-Cartermatic

Yeah, put the dick in they mouth, so I guess it's fuck what they say
I'm high as a bitch, up up and away, man I come down in a couple of days
Okay, you want me up in the cage, then I'll come out in beast mode
I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G-code

It's Weezy motherfucker, Blood gang and I'm in bleed mode
All about my dough, but I don't even check the peephole
So you can keep knockin', but won't knock me down
No love lost, no love found

Eminem
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now

Lil Wayne
Yeah

Eminem
You kicked me when I was down, fuck what you say just don't

Lil Wayne
That's right (Don't hurt me)
I don't need you (No more)
Don't want to see you (No more)
Huh

Eminem
Bitch you get no (No love)

You showed me nothing but hate, you ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around (Yeah)

Lil Wayne

Eminem
I'm alive again, more alive than I have been in my whole entire life I can
See these people's ears perk up as I begin to spaz with the pen
I'm a little bit sicker than most, shit's fi'in to get thick again
They say the competition is stiff, but I get a hard dick from this shit, now stick it in

I ain't never givin' in again, caution to the wind, complete freedom
Look at these rappers how I treat 'em, so why the fuck would I join 'em when I beat 'em?
They call me a freak 'cause I like to spit on these pussies 'fore I eat 'em
Man get these whack cocksuckers off stage, where the fuck is Kanye when you need him?

Snatch the mic from 'em, bitch I'ma let you finish in a minute, yeah that rap is tight but I'm
'Bout to spit the greatest verse of all time, so you might want to go back to the lab tonight and um
Scribble out them rhymes you were going to spit, and start over from scratch and write new ones
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference, when I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight

It's an adrenaline rush, you feel the bass thump in the place all the way to the parking lot fellow
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd, you can see the sparks from hot metal
Cold-hearted from the day I bogarted the game, my soul started to rot fellow
When I'm not even in my harshest, you can still get roasted 'cause Marsh is not mellow

Till I'm toppling from the top I'm not going to stop, I'm standing on my Monopoly board
That means I'm on top of my game and it don't stop, till my hip don't hop anymore
When you're so good that you can't say it, 'cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore
People just get sick 'cause you spit, these fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore

And you can never break my stride, you never slow the momentum at any moment
I'm 'bout to blow, you'll never take my pride, I'm killin' the flow, slow venom any opponent
Is getting no mercy, mark my words ain't letting up relentless, I smell blood
I don't give a fuck, keep giving 'em hell, where was you when I fell and needed help up? You get no love

Eminem,Space Bound,"We touch, I feel a rush, we clutch it isn't much
But it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
It's lust, it's torturous, you must be a sorceress
'Cause you just did the impossible, gained my trust

Don't play games it'll be dangerous, if you fuck me over
'Cause if I get burnt, I'ma show ya what it's like to hurt
'Cause I've been treated like dirt before ya
And love is evil, spell it backwards I'll show ya

Nobody knows me I'm cold, walk down this road all alone
It's no one's fault but my own, it's the path I've chosen to go
Frozen as snow, I show no emotion whatsoever, so
Don't ask me why I have no love for these mo'fuckin' hoes

Blood sucking succubuses, what the fuck is up with this
I've tried in this department, but I ain't had no luck with this
It sucks, but it's exactly what I thought it would be
Like trying to start over

I got a hole in my heart, like some kind of emotional roller coaster
Something I won't go on, so you toy with my emotions ho it's over
It's like an explosion every time I hold ya, wasn't joking when I told ya
You take my breath away, you're a supernova and I'm a

I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aiming right at you, right at you, right at you

I'll do whatever it takes, when I'm with you I get the shakes
My body aches when I ain't, with you I have zero strength
There's no limit on how far I would go, no boundaries, no lengths
Why do we say that until we get that person that we think's

Gonna be that one and then once we get 'em, it's never the same
You want 'em when they don't want you, soon as they do feelings change
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
I wasn't looking when I stumbled on to you, must have been fate

But so much is at stake, what the fuck does it take
Let's cut to the chase, 'fore the door shuts in your face
Promise me, if I cave in and break and leave myself open
That I won't be making a mistake, 'cause I'm a

I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aiming right at you, right at you, right at you

So after a year and six months, it's no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts, never mistreated you once
I poured my heart out to you, let down my guard, swear to God
I'll blow my brains in your lap, lay here and die in your arms

Drop to my knees and I'm pleading, I'm trying to stop you from leaving
You won't even listen so fuck it, I'm trying to stop you from breathing
I put both hands on your throat, I sit on top of you squeezing
Till I snap your neck like a Popsicle stick

Ain't no possible reason I could think of
To let you walk up out this house and let you live
Tears streamed down both of my cheeks, then I let you go and just give
And 'fore I put that gun to my temple, I told you this

And I would've did anything for you
To show you how much I adored you
But it's over now, it's too late to save our love
Just promise me you'll think of me
Every time you look up in the sky and see a star, 'cause I'm a

I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you, right at you

And I'm so lost without you, without you, without you"

So fuck it
Some of us don't get a second chance

Who can catch lightnin' in a bottle, set fire to water
Comin' out the nozzle on a fire hose, flyer than swatters
(Cinderella man, Cinderella man, Cinderella man, Cinderella man)
Smash an hourglass, grab the sand, take his hands and cup 'em
Spit a rhyme to freeze the clock; take the hands of time and cuff 'em
(Cinderella man, Cinderella man, Cinderella man, Cinderella man)

There's a storm comin' that the weatherman couldn't predict
I start the bug prick, you better flea 'cause I get ticked
It's a wrap; I was down, when I was down I was kicked
I got up, I'm back to punch you to the ground, you're tricked

It's a trap; fuck my last CD, that shit's in my trash
I'll be goddamned if another rapper gets in my ass
I hit the gas and I spit every rap as if it's my last
You can die in the blink of an eye, so bat your eyelashes

And keep winkin' and blowin' kisses 'cause you're flirtin' with death
I'm destroyin' your livelihood, I ain't just hurtin' your rep
I catch a flow and get goin'; no remorse I'm showin', ain't slowin' for no one
Knowin' there's nothin' you can do about it

Zeroin' on my target like a marksman, the target is you
I shut your lane down, took your spot; parked in it, too
Arsenic flow, lighter fluid, saliva—what can you do?
Go get your crew to hype you up; stand behind you like, wooh

That boy's hot enough to melt hell, burn Satan, too
Fry his ass and put his ashes back together with glue
So you can hate him, he don't blame you; frankly, he would, too
This game could ill-afford to lose him; how 'bout you?

Now guess who (hey), here's a clue (hey)

Fuck catchin' lightnin'; he struck it; screamed ""Shut up"" at thunder
Then flipped the world upside down and made it rain upward

Rewound the future to the present, paused it, don't ask how
Fuck the past, motherfucker; he's the shit right how
He's (Cinderella man, Cinderella man, Cinderella man, Cinderella man)

Cinderella man, Cinder-fella, Shady Dane
Came to wrap the game up in cellophane, raise hell; from hell he came
But didn't come to bore ya with the Cinderella story
Nor did he come to do the same ol'; can't afford to be a lame-o

In this day and age and at this stage of the game
Mediocrity can no longer be allowed to fly
So say bye to the old, H-I to the new, Que Sera
Consider it his last hurrah, the coup de grace; raise 'em high

In the sky, keep 'em out, time to bring the place alive
Thanks for bein' patient; I won't make no more mistakes, shit
My potatoes baked homie, the veggies on my plate can fly
My filet is smokin' weed; yeah, faggot, the stakes are high

Shit, I ain't even s'pposed to be here by the grace of God
The skin on my teeth and a hair on my nuts, I skated by
Now y'all are on thin ice with ankle weights, I'd hate to lie
How fuckin' irritated are you, how much in your face am I?

And ain't shit you can do but fear it; Proof is here in spirit
And I'm his spittin' image; I mirror it when I stand near it
Your pussy lyric, I cunt hear it
Who forms pyramids and raps circles around square lyricists?

Who (hey), here's a clue (hey)

Eminem,25 To Life,"Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life

Yeah, too late
I can't keep, chasing you
I'm taking my life back
Caught in a chase, 25 to life

I don't think she understands, the sacrifices that I've made
Maybe if this bitch had acted right, I would have stayed
But I've already wasted over half my life, I would have laid
Down and died for you, I no longer cry for you, no more pain

Bitch you, took me for granted took my heart and ran it
Straight into the planet, into the dirt I can no longer stand it
Now my respect I demand it, I'ma take control of this relationship command it
And I'ma be the boss of you now goddammit

And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me
So you better hear me out, this much you owe me
I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you I have stayed
Faithful all the way, this is how I fuckin' get repaid

Look at how I dress, fuckin' baggy sweats, go to work a mess
Always in a rush to get back to you, I ain't heard you yet
Not even once say you appreciate me, I deserve respect
I've done my best to give you nothin' less than perfectness

And I know that if I end this, I'll no longer have nothin' left
But you keep treatin' me like a staircase, it's time to fuckin' step
And I won't be comin' back, so don't hold your fuckin' breath
You know what you've done, no need to go in depth

I told you'd be sorry if I fuckin' left, I'd laugh while you wept
How's it feel now, yeah funny ain't it
You neglected me, did me a favor though my spirit free you've set
But a special place for you, in my heart I have kept, it's unfortunate but it's

Too late for the other side (yeah)
Caught in a chase, 25 to life (can't take no more, can't take no more)
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life

I feel like when I bend over  (too late) backwards for you, all you do is laugh
'Cause that ain't good enough, you expect me to fold myself in half
Till I snap, don't think I'm loyal, all I do is rap
How can I moonlight on the side, I have no life outside of that

Don't I give you enough of my time, you don't think so do you
Jealous when I spend time with the girls, why I'm married to you
Still man I don't know, but tonight I'm serving you with papers
I'm divorcin' you, go marry someone else and make 'em famous

And take away their freedom, like you did to me, treat 'em
Like you don't need 'em and they ain't worthy of you, feed 'em
The same shit that you made me eat, I'm movin' on forget you
Oh, now I'm special, I ain't feel special when I was with you

All I ever felt was dissed, helplessness, imprisoned by a selfish bitch
Chew me up and spit me out, I fell for this so many times, it's ridiculous
And still I stick with this, I'm sick of this
But in my sickness and addiction, you're addictive as they get

Evil as they come, vindictive as they make 'em
My friends keep askin' me, why I can't just walk away from 'em
I'm addicted to the pain the stress the drama, I'm drawn to shit
I guess I'm a mess, cursed and blessed

But this time I ain't changin' my mind, I'm climbin' out this abyss
You're screamin' as I walk out that I'll be missed
But when you spoke of people who meant the most to you, you left me off your list
Fuck you hip-hop, I'm leaving you, my life sentence is served bitch

And it's just
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life (I'm gone man)
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life

Too late
Caught in a chase, 25 to life"
Eminem,So Bad,"Spoken
Yeah, haha, you feel that baby?
Yeah I feel it too, damn.
You know, I'm so glad we could spend this time together.
See, I'm not as crazy as you thought I was, am I?

I'm the American dream, I'm the definition of white trash ballin'
I'm right back on 'em with the *rchick-rchick-chicka-chick*
I can't call it, same shit different toilet
Oh ya, got a nice ass darlin'

Can't wait to get you into my Benz, take you for a spin
What you mean we ain't fuckin', you take me for a friend
Lemme tell you the whole story of Shady's origin
You'll be sorry, if you slam my Mercedes door again

Now, it all started with my father
I musta got my pimpin' genes from him, the way he left my mama
I'm a rollin' stone just like him, word to Johnny Drama
Keep my entourage wit me, baby I make a promise

There ain't nobody as bomb as me, I'm calm as the breeze
I'm the bee's knees, his legs and his arms
I'm a superstar girl, I'm ready for you mama
Why you think the only thing I got on is my pajamas

So bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you've ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna want to fuck nobody else again

So bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you've ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna want to fuck nobody else again

I'm equivalent to a shot of Cuervo, first I kiss your navel
Work my way down, baby you can lay down on the table
But you may want to find something more stable
I told you I ain't foolin from the gate, this ain't the first day of April

But thank you for staying April, I'ma make you
Learn to appreciate me, differentiate me
From these phony little fishy and sissy fake G's
Skip over the huggie bear and all the kissy face please

Initiate phase three, missy now service me
Take another shot of Jager, shake it so nervously
Take your time baby, ooh you're the bomb baby
Ooh you're doing that even better than your mom lady

I told you I'm shady, you didn't listen now did ya
Relax woman, you know that I'm only kiddin' with ya
Got a twisted sense of humor, it's warped but I didn't hit ya
I think you're finally startin' to get the picture, I'm just

So bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you've ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna want to fuck nobody else again

So bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you've ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna want to fuck nobody else again

'Cause I'm on to the next girl
And the next girl I kinda like, oh oh oh

I got you caught up in the rapture, make you recapture
The feelings you had for your last boyfriend before he slapped ya
You never wanted someone so bad you're sweatin'
But if I'm what you wanted, why'd you panic when I grabbed ya

Girl don't be so frantic, I'm just a hopeless romantic
Don't try to fight the feelin' of something that's so organic
You can't ignore it, so don't, just stand before it
Just drop them panties to the floor, let's get the cam 'cordin', damn shortie

I told you this is bound to happen
Soon as you wrote your number on a napkin
I was bound to work a number on your back and throw your spine out of alignment
My love has got you so blinded, you couldn't pick Amy Winehouse out of a lineup

So stop at the store and pick a pint up
Let's get the Pineapple Schnapps goin', no one will knock 'cause I'ma hang a sign up
Sayin' don't disturb, shorty I'm so superb
I say the right things, don't I spit the dopest words

So bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you've ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna want to fuck nobody else again

Lightyears ahead o' you

Woo!"
Eminem,Almost Famous,"Yeah, can't stop now
Maybe the last chance I get

You dream of trading places, I have been changing faces
You cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose
Wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenseless
There is too much to lose, you can not fill these shoes

I just wanna be famous but
Be careful what you wish for

I stuck my dick in this game like a rapist, they call me Slim Roethlisberger
I go berserker than a fed up post office worker
A murker wit a Mossberg, I'm pissed off, get murdered
Like someone took a ketchup squirter, squirted a frankfurter

For a gangster ya sure did shit your pants when you saw
That chainsaw get to waivin' like a terrible towel
How things turn around when his fangs come out, get your brains blown out
That's what I call blowin' your mind, when I cum back like nut on your spine
I'm the thumb tack that you slept on, son
Now here I come screamin' 'a tac' like I just stepped on one

Low on the totem till he showed em defiance, giant scrotum
He don't owe them bitches shit, his britches, he out-growed 'em
He's so out cold he's knocked out at the South Pole
And nobody fucks with him, rigor mortis and post mortem

He's dyin' of boredom, take your best rhymes, record 'em
To try and thwart em, he'll just take your punch lines and snort 'em
Shit stained drawers, you gon' fuck wit a guy who licks the blades of his chainsaws
While he dips em in P.F. Chang sauce

Games off homie, hang it up like some crank calls
You think im backin' down, you must be out of your dang skulls
I'm almost famous

You dream of trading places, I have been changing faces
You can not fill these shoes, there is too much to lose
Wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenseless
There is too much to lose, you can not fill these shoes

I just wanna be famous but
Be careful what you wish for

I'm back for revenge, I lost the battle, that ain't happenin' again
I'm at your throat like strep, I step, strapped with a pen
Metaphors wrote on my hand, some are just stored in my memory
Some are wrote on a napkin, I do what I have to to win

Pullin' out all stops, any who touch a mic prior's
Not even Austin Powers, how the fuck are they Mike Myers
And tell that psycho to pass the torch to the wacko
'Fore I take a shit in his jack-o-lantern and smash it on his porch

Now get off my dick, dick's too short of a word for my dick
Get off my anti-disestablishment-arianism, you prick
Don't call me the champ, call me the space shuttle destroyer
I just blew up the Challenger, matter fact I need a lawyer

I just laced my gloves wit enough plaster to make a cast
Beat his ass naked and peed in his corner like Vern Troyer
Y'all are Eminem backwards, your Meni Me's
See he's in a whole 'nother weight class, he's slugs, you're bb's

You're bean bag bullets, you're full of it, you were dissin' his CD's
Laughed at Infinite, now he's back like someone pissed in his Wheaties
No peace treaties, he's turned into a beast
His new Slim Shady EP's got the attention of the mighty D-R-E
He's almost famous

You dream of trading places, I have been changing faces
You can not fill these shoes, there is too much to lose
Wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenseless
There is too much to lose, you can not fill these shoes

I just wanna be famous but
Be careful what you wish for

Now there he goes in Dre's studio cuppin' his balls
Screamin' the wood off the panelin', cussin' the paint off the walls
Spewin' his hate to these haters, showin' no love for these broads
He ain't givin' 'em shit, he says he'll pinch a penny so hard

He'll leave a bruise on the bronze so dark you can see the mark when it scars
Till Abraham Lincoln is screamin' out awww
His metaphors and similes ain't similar to them, not at all
If they don't like it, they can all get fucked instead of suckin' him off

They can go get a belt or a necktie to hang themselves by
Like David Carradine, they can go fuck themselves and just die
And eat shit while they're at it, he's fuckin' had it, he's mad at the whole world
So go to Hell and build a snowman, girl

The bully's become bullied, if pussies get pushed then they better pull me
Take me back to ninth grade to school me
'Cause I ain't lookin' back, only forward, this whole spot, blow it
Who could have known he'd grow to be a poet and not know it

And while im being poetic, let me get historic
And raise the bar, higher than my opinion of these women's been lowered
So bare witness to some biblical shit, there's a cold wind blowin'
This world ain't gonna know what hit it, he did it, he made it
He's finally famous"
Eminem,Love The Way You Lie,"Rihanna:
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Eminem:
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe but I still fight, while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight

High off her love, drunk from her hate, it's like I'm huffin' paint
And I love her the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates
Me, she fucking hates me and I love it, wait

Where you going, I'm leaving you, no you ain't
Come back, we're running right back here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's going good it's going great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane

But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped ""who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

Rihanna:
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Eminem:
You ever love somebody so much, you can barely breathe when you're with 'em
You meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah them chills used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em

You'd swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em
Now you're in each others' face, spewing venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push pull each others' hair, scratch claw bit 'em
Throw 'em down pin 'em, so lost in them moments when you're in 'em

It's the rage that took over, it controls ya both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over

But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again, now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

Rihanna:
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Eminem:
Now I know we said things, did things, that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
But when it comes to love, you're just as blinded, baby please

Come back, it wasn't you, baby it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though

Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall

Next time, there will be no next time, I apologize
Even though I know it's lies, I'm tired of the games
I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire

Rihanna:
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie"
Eminem,Untitled,"Singing with Spoken 
(You don't own me, don't try to change me)
Nah man, not quite finished yet.

Girl I think you just mighta tried to pull a mo'fuckin' fast one I'm mad
You just hurt my goddamn feeling and that was the last one I had
Does this look like an arcade, tryin' to play games, see this saw blade
See the silhouette of a stalker in your walkway, better cooperate

Or get sauteed and rotisseried, while you're hog-tied
MC's get so quiet, you can hear a mo'fuckin' dog whistle when I walk by
Colt Seavers on a mule, stuntin' on that ass like the fuckin' Fall Guy
I don't gas my Mercedes after midnight, I treat it like a mogwai

'Cause it will turn into a gremlin and run over kids women and men
Vnnn-vnnn motor's so big, you can fit a midget in his engine
Bitch, give me them digits, why you cringin', not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin
Will I spend spend even ten cents on you since when

Do you think it's gonna cost me a pretty penny
Shit, if I think a penny's pretty, just imagine how beautiful a quarter is to me
Eenie-meenie-miney-mo, catch an Eskimo by his toe, while he's trying to roll a snowball
But don't make him lose his cool, if he hollers better let him go ya'll

'Cause...
(You don't own me, don't try to change me)
Now here we go, go, go

Get up baby get a move on, like a U-Haul, you can rack your brain like pool balls
You won't ever think of this shit, yeah honey you called?
Well here I come, Havoc on the beat, I wreak it, evil I see hear and speak it
Lady put your money on Shady, fuck that other weak shit

Put your eggs in the same basket, you can count every mo'fuckin' chicken 'fore it hatches
'Cause, you can bet your ass that we gon' get it crackin'
Like the Kraken and Titans when they're clashin', get your brains bashed in
So bad you gon' have Kurt Cobain askin' to autograph a bloodstained napkin

Unfashionable and 'bout as rational as a rash on a fag's asshole
Now let's take that line run it up the flag pole with Elton
See if he's cool with it, don't stand there and look stupid at
Me bitch, I ain't in the mood for this shit, get my dick, Google it

Till it pops up, ya'll are so motherfuckin' full of shit that you've stopped up
Me, I'm always shittin' diarrhea of the mouth, till your speakers crap out, *fart* Ohp what
Girl you got a hot butt like a lit cigarette, ""Chik-Chigarette""
But you won't get a hot fudge Sundae from me, so do not strut my way slut

Because...
(You don't own me, don't try to change me)
Now here we go, go, go

And now that I got your panties in a bunch, and your bowels in an uproar
I'ma show you why I came, so you stop askin' me what the fuck for
Now look you little slut cunt whore, I know you want more
Bitch it's time to put the math back in the Mathers, 'cause I'm a fuckin' problem, run boy

Every flow got it mastered, so every last word that you fuckin' fags heard
Comes straight from the fishes ass, yeah in other words I'm a bass-turd
Lookin' at me like I killed Kenny, gas in the tank yeah still plenty
No morals are instilled in me, so remorse I really don't feel any

Eat your heart out Hannibal, understandable why you're jealous, fuck an animal
I got cannibal magnetism, can't resist him now, can ya ho?
Shady I don't understand your flow, understand my flow, bitch I flow like Troy
Polamalu's hair boy, don't you dare try to follow or compare boy

I'm raw, you ain't even medium rare, stay the fuck outta my hair boy
You can look, you can stare point, but you can't touch, I'm too clairvoyant
I don't get it man is there a void, all this weak shit, what am I steroids
Well bitch I'm back, with some shit for that ass, and your trunk, elephant hemorrhoids

And remember boys...
(You don't own me, don't try to change me)
Now here we go, go, go

Thank you for coming out
Hope you enjoyed the show
Till next time

Eminem,Walk On Water (feat. Beyoncé),"I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes (fuck)

Why are expectations so high?
Is it the bar I set? My arms I stretch, but I can't reach
A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp
But as soon as I grab, squeeze

I lose my grip like the flyin' trapeze
Into the dark I plummet, now the sky's blackening
I know the mark's high, butter-flies rip apart my stomach
Knowin' that no matter what bars I come with
You're gonna harp, gripe, and that's a hard Vicodin to swallow
So I scrap these as pressure increases like khakis
I feel the ice cracking, because

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
(It’s the curse of the— it’s the curse of the—)
I walk on water (shit)
But only when it freezes

It's the curse of the standard that the first of the Mathers discs set
Always in search of the verse that I haven't spit yet
Will this step just be another misstep
To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect

I've garnered? The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless
And it always feels like I'm hittin' the mark
Till I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart
Like, ""This shit is garbage!""
And God's given me all this
Still I feel no different regardless
Kids look to me as a god, this is retarded
If only they knew, it's a facade and it's exhaustive

And I try not to listen to nonsense
But if you bitches are tryin' to strip me of my confidence
Mission accomplished
I'm not God-sent, Nas, Rakim, Pac, B.I.G., James Todd Smith, and I'm not Prince

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water (it's true, it's true)
But only when it freezes

'Cause I'm only human, just like you
Making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh

It's true, I'm a Rubik's, a beautiful mess
At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest
A flawed human, I guess
But I'm doin' my best to not ruin your ex-

Pectations and meet 'em, but first the ""Speedom"" verse
Now Big Sean he's goin' too fast, is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?
There was a time I had the world by the balls, eatin' out my palm
Every album song I was spazzin' the fuck out on
And now I'm gettin' clowned and frowned on
But the only one who's looking down on me that matters now's DeShaun
Am I lucky to be around this long?

Begs the question though, especially after the methadone
As yesterday fades and the Dresden home
Is burnt to the ground, and all that's left of my house is lawn
The crowds are gone
And it's time to wash out the blonde
Sales decline, the curtain's drawn
They're closin' the set, I'm still pokin' my head from out behind
And everyone who has doubt, remind

Now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times
Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares or gives a fuck about your rhymes
And as I grow outta sight, outta mind, I might go outta mine
'Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight
When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?

But when I do fall from these heights though, I'll be fine
I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine
But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around, 'cause

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

'Cause I'm only human, just like you
I've been making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh
If I walked on water, I would drown

'Cause I'm just a man
But as long as I got a mic, I'm godlike
So me and you are not alike
Bitch, I wrote ""Stan"""
Eminem,Believe,"And I started from the bottom
Like a snowman, ground-up
Like round chuck and still put hands on you
Stayin' wound up is how I spend time
Sucker free, confidence high
Such a breeze when I pen rhymes
I just got the air about me like wind chimes (yeah)

Another day in the life (uh)
Used to have to scrape to get by (yeah)
Now my community's gated and I
Made it and my neighbors say hi
I'm givin' 'em pounds, I'm upscale now
Guess it means I'm way in the sky

But I still remember the days of
Minimum wage for general labor
Welfare recipient since a minor
Look how government assistance has made ya
Adversity, if at first you don't succeed
Put your temper to more use
'Cause bein' broke's a poor excuse

That should only give you more fuel
Show 'em why you're you
So close, God, it's like I almost got it
But close only counts in time bombs and horseshoes
So I Unabomb shit-tick, tick, tick-no remorse, pew
Screw it, I'm lit, and that attitude I blew up on quick
That's why they call me firecracker
I grew up on wick-wick, wick, wick-with a short fuse
I got some important news to report to
Anyone who thought I was done: nah bitch, not quite
Spotlight's back on, got my faith, where's yours?

Do you still believe in me?
Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now and walk out
I will never let you live it down
(I'll never quit) Do you still believe in me?

Man, I know sometimes
These thoughts can be harsh and cold as ice
To me they're just ink blots
I just fling 'em like slingshots and so precise

So you might want to think it over twice
When you retards can roll the dice
But beef will at least cost you your career
'Cause even my cheap shots are overpriced

But this middle finger's free as a bird
Nuke warheaded birth, hugest forehead on Earth
Too short for the verse, studied his formula, learned
How to incorporate a curse
Point it towards corporate America

Stick a fork in and turn
'Cause four-letter words are more better heard
The world force-fed a turd to me
You're gettin' yours

But sometimes I overdo it, but I just get so into it
I was there consolin' you when no one knew it
When your situation showed no improvement
I was that door, you walked over to it
I'm the light at the end of tunnel
So people are always lookin' at me as they're goin' through it

When that tunnel vision is unclear
Shit becomes too much to bear
Since ""Cleanin' Out My Closet""
When I was havin' trouble with the snare

I'm that unrealistic prayer answered
And I'ma get you jacked up
Like you're tryin' to fix a flat, uh
When you struggle with despair
That double-fisted, bare-knuckles coupled with this pair
Of nuts I'm cuppin', I am your fuckin' switch, nothin' can compare

Do you still believe in me?
Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now
And walk out, I will never let you live it down
(I'll never quit) Do you still believe in me?

Started from the bottom like a snowman
Oh man, put that in your corncob pipe and smoke that
But my battery's low, I'ma need a boost to my pack
And I know that I always got Proof at my back
I called you ""Proof"" because I knew for a fact

My ace in the hole, homie, I'm callin' on you
'Cause I think I'm slowly startin' to lose faith in it, so
Give me that apron and mo-
-Tivation to go, Hussein with the flow
Fake fans left you two-faced at the show
Let heartbeats loop, produce hate in my soul
Layin' vocals two days in a row

True statement, hate to go down this road
But there's only one route to cross this bridge
So I walk in this bitch with loose change
'Cause all my dues paid, but this booth's takin' its toll

But it's never too late to start a new beginning
That goes for you too, so what the fuck you gon' do?
Use the tools you're given
Or you're gon' use the cards you're dealt
As an excuse for you to not do shit with 'em?
I used to play the loser/victim
Till I saw the way Proof was driven

I found my vehicle and I haven't ran out of gas yet
And when they stacked decks, turn handicaps into assets
Fanny packs, hourglasses
If time was on my side, I'd still have none to waste
Man, in my younger days
That dream was so much fun to chase

It's like I run in place
While this shit dangled in front of my face
But how do you keep up the pace
And the hunger pains once you've won the race?

When that fuel exhaust is coolin' off
'Cause you don't got nothin' left to prove at all
'Cause you done already hit 'em with the coup de grâce
Still you feel the need to go full tilt
That Bruce Willis, that Blue Steel, that true skill
When that wheel's loose, I won't lose will
Do you still believe?"
Eminem,Chloraseptic (feat. Phresher),"Instinctive nature to bring the anguish (yeah)

With this ink, you haters get rode on like a piece of paper
This rap shit got me travellin' place to place
You barely leave your house
'Cause you're always stuck at your pad, it's stationary

Yeah, that's why when I brainstorm, gotta write it out
Simon Cowell of rhymin' foul, that's why you sound so shook
Wire bound notebook got tied around your throat
Hook it inside your mouth, go-hruh
That's what it's like when the mic is out

'Cause I'm tearin' at your flesh with it
Till your larynx and neck are split
With these lyrics, weapons, expert with
Like hair extensions, extra clips
And you're scared to effin' death of it
Bitch, you're starin' at a legend, that
In a pair of Skechers, sweatshirt ripped
And hoodie black, should be strapped

To a chair or stretcher, electric, swear on every record, bitch
Finger so high in the air, I'll bet your senses flip
Like a barometric pressure switch
Carin' less who I offend with this
I'm at your neck like Pez dispense
Go 'head, spit your flow, bitch

I'm at your throat like chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with, 'plex with
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah

And I'll take a hundred of you, hundred of you
All at once like I had nothin' to lose, what can I do?
My appetite for destruction is loose, destruction is loose
And all it wants is to have somethin' to chew
Somethin' to chew (somethin' to chew)

Yeah, uh, and still conjoined at
The hip with hop, still on point and poignant
Skilled as Floyd is
In this field, and still no filter, boy
I'll put you in your place (yeah) like a realtor, boy
You still ain't in the building, boy

I will destroy shit, even as I build it
Get the drillbit, pen is filled with poison
Which is the source, easy to still pinpoint it
(Like what?) Like a real thin joint it
(What?) Comes on Quilted Northern
(And what?) In a built-in toilet
(Yeah) Bitch, I told you I'm a dog (woof)

I wouldn't heal with ointment
Way I'm kickin' these fairies tales
Should write a children's storybook (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Million voices in my head
But still get a little bit of thrill and some real enjoyment
(Off what?) Off the feel of going in
(Like?) Like your bitch when she gives me brain

Like she thinks I'm dumb
Grabs the crown of my dick and blows me to kingdom come
Till I feel anointed
She makes iller noises
When she's with me, must be from the Windy City
Pretty apparent, she's a MILF when blowin' me

'Cause I conned her into
Rippin' the condom in two (woo)
Dick is a bargaining tool
Now I'm gettin' blew like Klonopins, Rude Jude
I go there, you wouldn't?
Well, I still have a few views in common with you
Just not YouTube, 'cause

I'm at your throat like chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with, 'plex with
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah

You're a has-been
That has been the case since back when
You last went and threw your hat in the race
You've been trash, stick your raps in the trash bin
Or end up in my next rhyme
You're a fuckboy, so next time
It's gonna be heads flyin' like Dez Bryant
With a TEC-9 against Rex Ryan (yeah)

Now watch me set it like correct time
All you get is sloppy seconds like a Timex, I
Clock rejects into the next life
Talkin' reckless, but it's just my
Strongest suit, but you can get my Columbian neck tie
Prostitute, just climb in the Humvee and let's ride

Why you hitching at night?
I put an end to your life, sex crime
Kidding aside, insidious vibe
Girl, you know you got the prettiest eyes
But all you're getting is bribe
Ending your life to try to get you inside
Then we gon' end up spending the night
And I'm skinning your hide like an Indian tribe

What kind of nut drives a Budweiser truck
Finds a slut, tries to surprise her, cuffs, ties her up
Binds up, cuts, slices her twice?
But the muff diver must just like it rough
Fuck right in her vagina, blood
Flies up on the visor, like a geyser, uh
(Music, please)

Enthusiast of the roofie
Goal is to get a floozy inside the Jacuzzi
And have a loosey-goosey as Cool C is with an Uzi
But I am to rap what blue jeans mean to Bruce Springsteen
Glued we be, I'm truTV, you're too PG
I'm Schoolly D, you're Spoonie Gee

No diss there, just notice there
Are no similarities that we share
Besides the fact we breathe air
Happily married to rap and I'm glad that we buried
The hatchet and patched it up
Now I'm back to ratchet up my attack
And I'm at your motherfuckin' throat like

Chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with, 'plex with
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah

And I'll take a hundred of you, hundred of you
All at once like I had nothin' to lose, what can I do?
My appetite for destruction is loose, destruction is loose
And all it wants is to have somethin' to chew
Somethin' to chew (somethin' to chew)"
Eminem,Untouchable,"Hands up, officer don't shoot
Then pull your pants up, promise you won't loot
We may never understand each other, it's no use
We ain't ever gonna grasp what each other goes through

Black boy, black boy, we ain't gonna lie to you
Black boy, black boy, we don't like the sight of you
Pull up on the side of you
Window rolled down, 'profile'
Then we wonder why we see this side of you

Probably comin' from the dope house
We could let you slide but your tail light is blew out
We know you're hidin' that Heidi Klum
On you another drug charge, homie, it's back inside for you

And just in case a chase might ensue, we got that tried and true
Pistol drew right at you, we'd be delighted to unload it
In your back, then walk up and lay that taser on the side of you
Fucked up, but what the fuck am I to do?

I keep tellin' myself, keep doin' like you're doin'
No matter how many lives you ruin
It's for the red, white and blue
Time to go find a new one and split his head right in two
No one's ever indicted you
Why? 'Cause you're a

White boy, white boy, you're a rockstar
(My mama talkin' to me, tryna tell me how to live)
White boy, white boy, in your cop car
(But I don't listen to her, 'cause my head is like a sieve)
White boy, white boy, you're untouchable
(The world's coming to an end, I don't even care)
Nobody can tell me shit 'cause I'm a (big rockstar)

Black boy, black boy, we don't get your culture and
We don't care what our government's done to fuck you over, man
Don't tell us your attitude's a result of that
Balderdash, where'd you get the chip on your shoulder at?

Why you kicking that soda can?
Pull your pants up, we 'bout to roll up and
Throw your ass in the van cuffed
You don't have to know our plans or what our intentions are
Our cards are close to our chest, you better show your hands

And put our minds more at ease
Or get shot in the thyroid, comply or die, boy
We're fightin' a crime war, here come the swine
Tryna clean up the streets from all these minorities

That's what we call 'em pigsties for
They're like eyesores to police
Talk to you like just a piece of trash
Feels like we're stuck in a time warp to me
As I kick these facts and get these mixed reactions
As this beat backspins, it's like we're drifting back in
To the sixties, having black skin is risky
'Cause this keeps happening
Throughout history, African-Americans have been treated like shit
And I admit, there have been times where it's been embarrassin' to be a

White boy, white boy, you're a rockstar
(My momma talkin' to me, tryna tell me how to live)
White boy, white boy, in your cop car
(But I don't listen to her, 'cause my head is like a sieve)
White boy, white boy, you're untouchable
(The world's coming to an end, I don't even care)
Nobody can tell me shit 'cause I'm a (big rockstar)

Seems like the average lifespan of a white man
Is more than twice than a black life span
I wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner
I feel like checking out on life, can't escape this circumstance

I'd rather hear 'em say ""Die N-word"" than Die Antwoord
Ninja, now it's better disguised banter
But that's life, strapped 'cause we're strapped financially
And can't find answers
We're applying, but McDonald's
Seems to be the only franchise that'll hire
So how can we have higher standards?

As Dallas overshadows the battle for Black Lives Matter
We fight back with violence but acts like that are
Black eyes on the movement
Which makes black lives madder
At cops and cops madder
That's why it's at a stalemate
And can't arrive at a compromise so it's Black Ops

I wonder if we hire more black cops, the crap stops
The block is our backyards, officers, not the crack spot
Call the attack dogs off of us, man
You always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop

And bad cops fuck it up for the good cops, and man, stop
Sendin' white cops into black neighborhoods
Who ain't acclimated to 'em, like that's the way to do it
Who seen some fuckin' videos of rappers waving guns
And know nobody black so they act afraid of us

And that's racism, the fear that a black face gives 'em
A subconscious racist
Wait, why are there black neighborhoods?
'Cause America segregated us, designated us to an area
Separated us, Section-Eight'd us
When we tear it up's the only time attention's paid to us
And education sucks, and every day's another
Freddie Gray for us, a levy breaks or fuzz

Why is it they treat us like dryer lint?
We just want a safe environment for our kids
But can't escape the sirens
Don't take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in
The poverty that we face so the crime rate's the highest in
The lowest classes, it's like a razor wire fence
And we're trapped in these racial biases
That plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise
Every time we see a devil's face

Lions, tigers and bears, oh my
It's more like billy clubs and gats
And we really love it when you think we're guilty 'cause we're black
""But you kill each other, facts
You peel each other's caps, for silly stuff like hats""

Single mother strugglin' through substance abuse
While people with nothin' to lose shoot each other for shoes
Fuck your Republican views
Pull ourselves up by our bootstraps, where the fuck are the boots?

And streets act as a narrator, don't gotta read comics
Or be that into characters, just to see that, just to be black
You better be strapped with a derringer
Or be ""capped in America"" like Steve Rogers

'Cause no one oversees these cops and
All we see is 'em beat charges
We done seen 'em beat Rodney King unconscious and got off
So we don't need all you crooked police officers' peace offerings

Just keep marchin', till we reach congress
But they're gonna say you're tryin' to take an irrational stance
If you try to slander the flag but
Somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb
So they call it a Kaepernick tantrum
If you don't stand for the national anthem

We raise it, you better praise it
Or you'll be made to feel like a traitor, we'll
Treat you like Rodney Dangerfield
Home of the brave is still racist 'ville
So this whole nation feels like a plantation field

In a country that claims that its foundation was based on United States ideals
That had its Natives killed
Got you singin' this star-spangled spiel
To a piece of cloth that represents the ""Land of the Free"" that made people slaves to build"
Eminem,River (feat. Ed Sheeran),"I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water
Feel it washing over me

Oh, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth in my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

He's coming home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatch
On his breath's Jack is a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back

It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet pack
She's kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be moving on to the next?
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks

'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan
To stab him in the back, knife in hand
Says the relationship's hanging by a strand

So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, despite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him
I don't care, hi Susanne, but I shoulda said ""Bye Susanne""
After the first night, but tonight I am

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water
Feel it washing over me

Oh, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth in my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

One-night stand, turned into night staying
He was calling so might scram, now we hug tight and
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too

Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, ensued
And witnessed you hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you

So I revert to the studio like hole in the wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew

And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage of my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burning the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
Fuck

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water
Feel it washing over me

Oh, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth in my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

My name's (oh), my name's (oh)
Denver (oh), river run
Call me (oh), call me (oh)
River (oh), we'll let the river run

Always the bridesmaid, never the bride, hey
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
The seat was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm sliding on ice, maybe

That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
What I made you terminate, my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled

What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie to tell an unborn child?

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water
Feel it washing over me

Oh, little one (I'm sorry)
I don't want to admit to something (I fucked up)
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth in my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run"
Eminem,Remind Me (Intro),"Damn girl
You drive me crazy
You may be crazy too
You make me do things
I normally wouldn't do

You make me feel things
That I never felt
You gotta be the real thing
'Cause you remind me of myself"
Eminem,Remind Me,"Yo
I bust in, devilish grin, disgustin'
Asshole, freckled cheeks and a butt chin
Calling all party animals
Get on the floor when I pop up on some Whac-A-Mole shit

In search of a chick who stacked them so thick
And implants are so big
She can hang me up on that rack, big ol' tits
Like Anna Nicole Smith
Body's bananas and sass to go wit'

I spot you at first glance and go ""Shit!""
You wearin' those pants that don't fit
That butt won't ever give up
That's why you stick it out no matter what
'Cause you got an ass that won't quit

So, get on the horn, my saxophone
Grab hold of my instrument, get a grasp, and blow
You just laugh and go, ""heehee""
'Cause you're just as nasty so that's appropriate
That's why

I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (yeah, me)
I said I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me, nasty (yeah, me)

You know, I'm wearin' a new shirt tonight too, yo
With me on it

I'm lookin' at your tight rear like a sightseer
Your booty is heavy duty like diarrhea
The plan's to bring you to my house
You're drinkin' Jack and Beam
I'm thinkin' soon as trampolines so we should bounce

But you're out of your tube-top
If you're thinkin' that mi casa es su casa
Yeah, you're a cute fox
Perfect ten so back that up like a moonwalk
Girl, you're smokin' like Snoop Dogg

But you must be tokin' if you think you're takin' over my quarters
There goes the dime into the jukebox
Two shots of blue Hpnotiq and soon I'll
Turn this pool hall to a barroom brawl
So, Rick, scratch on the break like the cue ball
Turn the volume all the way up on your boombox

And excuse the locker room talk, I'm just too raw
But apparently, so are you, ma
'Cause you just kicked me in the balls and told me to screw off
And that's why

I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (yeah, me)
I said I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me, nasty (yeah, me)

Said can I take you home, where we can be alone?
Shorty, you the shit
Girl, I ordered you to sit
I know you're probably feelin' me more than you admit
Pull up a chair, sweetie, let me order you a drink
I only go to meetings court-ordered from a shrink

So from the bottom to the top, floor to ceiling
You ain't run of the mill, you're one in a million
'Cause real tits are still fun
But everybody knows fake tits are still better than real ones

So come and spend the night with the guy most are terrified of
But tonight, curiosity overrides ya
Besides you're fire (I love) like a starter pistol
Crystal and slides huns, tonight I'm your pilot

'Cause you should be up in the sky, girl
You're so fucking fly, you belong in the mile high club
So come on, baby, the night's young
Don't string me along, I'm high-strung

We might wind it up, unbound like we're trying for the Cy Young
Fuckin' 'fore we get to the house, screwin' our brains out
Like changing a lightbulb
That's why I like ya, 'cause I'm crazy just like ya

Now every time I get brain, you screw mine up
I barely can think straight, your head game is a mindfuck
So ready, set, aim and fire
Yes, babe, I'm fallin' in likeness kinda, why

I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (yeah me)
I said I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me, nasty (yeah, me)"
Eminem,Revival (Interlude),"I've drowned in high from the ashes
Now I can't recall your laughter
The smoke of everything go grasp
At ends of what's left over

And the lights in every broken
Blown-out window screaming, laughing
I hope to feel it coursing out
This is our revival"
Eminem,Like Home (feat. Alicia Keys),"Yeah, shout to everybody
Who's been on this trip with me
You don't have to agree
But if you feel like me

Someone get this Aryan a sheet
Time to bury him, so tell him to prepare to get impeached
Everybody on your feet
This is where terrorism and heroism meet, square off in the street

This chump barely even sleeps
All he does is watch Fox News like a parrot and repeats
While he looks like a canary with a beak
Why you think he banned transgenders from the military with a tweet?

He's tryin' to divide us
The shit's like a cult, but like Johnny he'll only unite us
'Cause nothin' inside drives us like this fight does
Similar to when two cars collide 'cause

Our spirit's crushed, and this spot's a tight one
But here the jaws of life come
To pull us from the wreckage that's what we get pride from
When we can't wear stars and stripes

'Cause this type of pickle we're in is hard to deal
But there's always tomorrow still
If we start from the scratch like a scab, get the scars to heal
And band together for Charlottesville

And for Heather, fallen heroes, fill this wall with murals
Nevada get up, hit the damn resetter
Let's start from zero, this is our renewal
Spray tan, get ride of, get a brand new, better
America, and here's to where we're from

And here's to where we all began, all began (stand up)
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am (hands up)
Here's to the land that raised me
This one's for the only place that really knows me
From the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like home

Didn't wanna piss your base off, did ya?
Can't denounce the Klan, 'cause they play golf with ya
You stay on Twitter, way to get your hate off Nazi
I do not see a way y'all differ

And all you got are race cards, bigot
The swastika with your name carved in it
Should be your trademark, 'cause hate's all you played off
And you just lick the plate off
So I guess it pays to feed off of chaos
So basically, you ate off Hitler

But you ain't ruinin' our country, punk
Or takin' our pride from us, you won't define us
'Cause like a dictionary, things are lookin' up
So much, got a sprained neck, know we would rise up

Against this train wreck and take a stand
Even if it means sittin' when they raise the flag
To sing ""The Star-Spangled Banner"", this man
Just praised a statue of General Lee 'cause he generally

Hates the black people, degrades Hispanics
Take it back to the Shady national convention
Wish I woulda spit on it before I went
To shake his hand at the event

Or maybe had the wherewithal
To know that he was gonna try to tear apart
Our sacred land we cherish and stand for
So, hands in the air, let's hear it for
The start of a brand new America
Without him and be proud of where we're from
And here's to where we're from

And here's to where we all began, all began (stand up)
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am (hands up)
Here's to the land that raised me
This one for the only place that really knows me
From the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like home

I won't give up
I won't give up on my home, that so many died for
You already know that I won't give up
I won't give up on my home, that so many died for
You already know
There's no place like home, no place like home
Wherever I go, no place like home
No place like home, no place like home
Wherever I go

Here's to where we all began, all began (stand up)
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am (hands up)
Here's to the land that raised me
This one for the only place that really knows me
From the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like home"
Eminem,Bad Husband (feat. X Ambassadors),"We never saw from each other's sides or eye to eye
Just eye for eye, lie for lie, fight or flight
So much baggage, need a luggage rack
But we carry on with our public spats and our feuds
Up back in the news, love taps when I dissed you
Like it was fun, actually used to run back to the booth
Jump back in the studio, give you a tongue lashing, then you
Laughed at a stomach tat with the tomb stone
It was funny back in our youth
But then it wasn't after we knew
That we were done and actually through (and actually through)

But if there's one fraction of truth
If it could be spun back I would do
So many things different, 'cause it was such a dumbass excuse
You hit me once and that I would use
To continue the pattern of abuse
Why did I punch back? Girls, your dad is a scumbag, I'm confused
Because

How come you can be a lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband

You were the beat I loved with a writer's block
The line that's hot, that I forgot
We laughed a little, cried a lot
I'll never forget when you came home and you held Hailie
Day before you went to jail and daily
How we'd wait for that mail lady
Or by the phone for Mom to call

And I watched you pull yourself up and we decided on
Giving it one more try despite it all
You're my lightning rod when my sky gets dark
I'm your shiny rocks in that tiny box
When we tied the knot, when we broke the knot
Every line we crossed we were supposed to not
Every time we fought, the insults, they got thrown too far

Words that we said that we didn't mean
The words that we meant that we didn't say
The ones that we thought that we shoulda said
Letters written that we could have read
Which maybe woulda lead to some good instead
And had this put to bed
But I'd be lyin' still if I said
I wasn't sittin' here askin' myself

How come you can be a lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband (Dad) (you said)
Forever be a hero in my eyes (I reply)
But there's always another side to a good father
A great dad, but a bad husband

We brought out the worst in each other
Someone had to make the sparring end
'Cause I loved you, but I hated that me
And I don't wanna see that side again
But I'm sorry, Kim
More than you could ever comprehend
Leaving you was fucking harder than
Sawing off a fucking body limb

Once upon a time we're all we had
Maybe that's what drew us
To each other, it was true love
Shit we never knew was possible
We might have loved each other too much
And maybe that's what made us do what
We did to each other, all the screw-ups
'Cause you always thought that you was
More in love with me, and I was thinking
I was more in love than you was

For all the times that we thought it worked
Till we saw how wrong we were
When the dust settles now and all the dirt
If I touch the rawest nerve
All I want is for us not to hurt

And it's been an exhaustive search to find the words
But I just heard ""Mockingbird""
And got the urge to jot some verses and thoughts
The purpose was not to stir up or open wounds
I've caused a few and so have you
Or argue whose fault it was partly yours

Partly mine, but really no one's
This is so tough, I'm getting choked up
Oh fuck it, we both suck
We broke up, got back together
We both thought we had forever
Not bad people, just bad together
We were so nuts, backstabbed each other
Another blow struck

But there's no duckin' this blow
'Cause it's over and it's closure
But I'm not so sure how to close this
I just don't know how some people can be so good
At one thing and so fucked at a whole 'nother
Shit, it's no wonder

How come, how come, you can be a lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband (Dad) (you said)
Forever be a hero in my eyes (I reply)
But there's always another side to a good father
A great dad, but a bad husband"
Eminem,Tragic Endings (feat. Skylar Grey),"I'm stumbling, I can't see straight
And it's my fault I got this way
I got my hands on something great
And found a way to mess it all up

I did my best, I tried to change
But it's just in my DNA
I got my hands on something great
And found a way to fuck it up again

Now I'm the one thing you couldn't hate more
But you're the one thing that I would die for

All my life I was told I was never nothing special
I don't need to be reminded of it every other second
'Specially when all my self-esteem's
Already shot to hell, I'm falling helplessly
I'm embarrased, I don't want no one else to see

'Cause I feel like I'm a piece of shit every time she yells at me
Selfishly addicted, definitely doesn't help that she
Makes me feel like I've died and gone to heaven
But makes life a living hell for me
She does that thing with her lip, now she's melting me

I'm putty in her palms, I'm wrapped around her finger
A yo-yo on a string, she lets me sit there and just dangle
Until something better comes along
And she'll just drop me like a hot potato
I look like I'm in pain, but I'm okay though

'Cause I know she loves me
My friends, what do they know?

It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there, but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings

I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
Drunk off tragic endings

In my moments of weakness
I openly admit the shit I wouldn't normally
I'm extremely self-conscious and enormously
Insecure and she uses it to torture when she torments me
It only turns to ammunition for her in this war, when she

Gets going she don't stop, when I'm up she's like a downer
When I found her it was love at first encounter
Plus, somehow she musta took the carton of eggs off the counter
Cracked them and placed all the shells on the ground for
Me to walk on when I'm around her

But there's just something about her
That makes me not able to function without her
How can I get out of it when I don't know how to?
I'm a doubter, I'm a pessimist, make a believer out of me
And show me the way now or stay the fuck out of my cloud of rain
'Cause I'm going straight down the drain, I'm drowning

It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there, but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings

I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
Drunk off tragic endings

Now I'm the one thing you couldn't hate more
But you're the one thing that I would die for

It took a while for me to get it, but I think I've figured it out
She don't want me, she just don't wanna see me with someone else
The idea of seeing me happy destroys her in itself
To see me falling to pieces brings her joy and brings her hell

But it annoys her to see me get this straight, then say ""screw her!""
I threw up on myself, I'm dumb sick, I'm addicted to her
She's tryna block the door, so here's how I do her
Since I'm manure, she's a sewer
And this time this piece of shit's running through her

I can see the light, now I'm running to it
What the fuck? Shoulda knew it
Who would think she'd actually have the balls to do it?
As soon as I hopped in it, she gassed the car with lighter fluid
She's standing there with a rag, 'bout to put the lighter to it
Lit the fucking thing on fire, then she threw it

It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there, but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings

I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
Drunk off tragic endings"
Eminem,Framed,"Feeling kinky
Lip syncing to Too $hort's ""Freaky Tales"" (Biatch)
Having creepy visions of whiskey drinking
Envisioning sneaking into where Christie Brinkley dwells
I know this is risky thinking but I wanna stick her like she decals

But when murdering females
Better pay attention to these details or you could be derailed
Better wear at least three layers of clothing or be in jail
If you get scratched because your DNA'll
Be all up under her fingernails

Man, he hears you, I don't think he cares
He gives a fuck, even his pinky swears
Three personalities burstin' out of me, please beware
Her TV blares, can't hear the creaking stairs
She's unaware in no underwear

She's completely bare
Turns around and screams, I remember distinctly
I said ""I'm here to do sink repairs.""
Chop her up, put her body parts
In front of Steven Avery's trailer and leave 'em there

But damnit, I was framed
I know what this looks like, officers
Please just give me one minute
I think I can explain
I ain't murdered nobody
I know these words are so nutty
But I'm just here to entertain

How come your shirt is so bloody?
There's a missing person, so what?
He's got nothin' to do with me
I'm almost certain I was framed

Woke up, it was dawn, musta knew somethin' was wrong
Think I'm becomin' a monster 'cause of the drugs that I'm on
Donald Duck's on as the Tonka Truck in the yard
But dog, how the fuck is Ivanka Trump in the trunk of my car?

Gotta get to the bottom of it to try to solve it
Must go above and beyond, 'cause it's incumbent upon
Me, 'cause I feel somewhat responsible for the dumb little blonde
Girl, that motherfuckin' baton twirler that got dumped in the pond

Second murder with no recollection of it
Collectin' newspaper articles, cuttin' up sections from it
Memory's too fucked to remember
Destructive temper cut my public defender's
Jugular then stuck him up in a blender

Another dismembered toddler
Discovered this winter probably
'Cause the disassembled body
Was covered up in the snow since the month of November oddly
I'm wanted for questioning
Them son of a bitches probably just wanna pin this on me

But hey man, I was framed
I know what this looks like, officers
Please just give me one minute
I think I can explain
I ain't murdered nobody
I know these words are so nutty
But I'm just here to entertain

How come your shirt is so bloody?
There's a missing person, so what?
He's got nothin' to do with me
I'm almost certain I was framed

Still on the loose, they
Spotted me inside McDonald's, Tuesday
In a Toronto Blue Jays cap, lookin' like your college roommate
With Rihanna, Lupe, Saddam Hussein, Bobby Boucher
Or was it Cool J? The cops is on a goose chase

Just escaped from the state pen
For rapin' eight women who hate men
Don't make it no weirder, I'm naked
When I break in your basement

Under your baby's play pen, I lay and wait adjacent
Facin' the door, remaining patient
While stayin' complacent blatant
Sexual implications are continuing to get thrown
Insinuations are placed in little riddles and poems
Left on your pillow in hopes, that when you get home
You'll get the hint, ho, I'm in your window

But it never occurred to me I could describe a murder scene
In a verse and be charged with first degree
'Cause it just happened to match up perfectly
With the massacre or the Burger King burglary
No, officer, you see

I was framed
I know what this looks like, officers
Please just give me one minute
I think I can explain
I ain't murdered nobody
I know these words are so nutty
But I'm just here to entertain

How come your shirt is so bloody?
There's a missing person, so what?
He's got nothin' to do with me
I'm almost certain I was framed"
Eminem,Nowhere Fast (feat. Kehlani),"Ashes blowing in the air
The world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin' back and we're never getting old
'Cause the skies are black, but our heart's made of gold
Fuck doin' what you're told
We're goin' nowhere fast

I feel sorry for this beat, sympathy pains for this track
This road is takin' me back down memory lane with this rap
I can still look out in this crowd, be wowed and be taken aback
I'm simply stating a fact, I had Wembley Stadium packed

But now we're on a path headed to nowhere and fast
Another terrorist attacks
Like a tariff, blows half of Madison Square up, alas
We perish in the blast
But that isn't scaring us, we pass nowhere we're fearless
'Cause we're just

Ashes blowing in the air
Our world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah
(We don't give a... no, no)
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin' back and we're never getting old
'Cause the skies are black
But our heart's made of gold (golden)
Fuck doin' what you're told (what we're told)
We're goin' nowhere fast

'Cause we're goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' nowhere
We're on the run of our lives
Goin' nowhere fast

Fuck doin' what you're told, act like a two-year old
Shit is soon to go kaboom and blow
Anyways; for MC's it's a funeral
When I'm devisin' this rhyme
'Cause I'm awake and you're mourning
That's why I rise and I shine
Like a new day has dawned on me

Gusto, guts, bravado
Nuts and plus I kick up dust and cuss a lot
I musta got you in somewhat of a debacle
'Cause some stuff that's awful
Really don't mean nothin' although
There's a lot of shit I said in jest that's tough to swallow

But if at times my heart it seems
Like it's in the wrong place
It's probably 'cause it's on my sleeve
Keanu Reeves speed of life, avoid or veer
Or just steer toward it, we're only lookin' forward
But where we're goin', we have no idea

Nowhere to go, but hysterical, it's gettin' warm in here
I set the world on fire, was born to be an arsonist
Just one spark and it's lit
But I'mma still get dark on this shit
Told you I'd leave my mark on this bitch-war machine

But you forced me in a corner
I'm sure to have somethin' for your rear
And in the course of the assault as torture gets more severe
Go to war with me, you'll end up blew to Timbuktu
I send at you a ten-ton nuke like Kim Jong-Un
And end up ruinin' your career

But when all is said and done
And at the end of my run I'll just rewind clocks, forever young
Make time stop, will I ever fall off? That day will never come
Till the pine box, bitch, fuck you! I'm better than I ever was
Till the bomb drops, hope it never does
But I'm not gonna sweat it 'cause
This world's screwed, it's already fucked
And I'm on top, so everyone's just

Ashes blowing in the air (so we're...)
Our world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah
(We don't give a... no, no)
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin' back and we're never getting old
'Cause the skies are black
But our heart's made of gold (golden)
Fuck doin' what you're told (what we're told)
We're goin' nowhere fast

'Cause we're goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' nowhere
We're on the run of our lives
Goin' nowhere fast

You can't tell us nothin'
Hard-headed and we're stubborn
So, one ear and out the other when we're young, we're young
(We're on the run of our lives)
Who knows what the future for us could hold
Another shooter? Uh oh
(We're on the run of our lives)
No more tomorrows, we're done
And all we are is-

Ashes blowing in the air (so we're...)
Our world's on fire, but we don't care (don't care, yeah)
(We don't give a... no, no)
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin' back and we're never getting old
'Cause the skies are black
But our heart's made of gold (golden)
Fuck doin' what you're told (what we're told)
We're goin' nowhere fast

(Post-Chorus: Kehlani)
'Cause we're goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' nowhere
We're on the run of our lives
Goin' nowhere fast"
Eminem,Heat,"Wanna take it from the top?

Lady, you remind me of my raps on that Relapse shit
'Cause you got an ass thick as them accents
Two asscheek implants, call that an asset
'Cause you could set a glass on it, it's massive

From the first time I saw you, I actually said to myself
""I gotta meet her"" like a taxi
Exactly, love affair in the backseat
Sorry if I'm being graphic

But I'm stiff as a statue, you sat on a shelf
I feel like I'mma bust, maybe I'm just ahead of myself
Let me slow down, slow your Camaro
I'm tryna catch up, I'm tryna jump your bones to the marrow

Got me under your control and your spell
Wanna wrap you up, put you in a bow like an arrow
Grab you by the (meow), hope it's not a problem, in fact
About the only thing I agree on with Donald is that

So when I put this palm on your cat
Don't snap, it's supposed to get grabbed
Why do you think they call it a snatch?

I just wanna climb in the sack
I'ma keep it a hundred like my speedometer's at
I'm watchin' you rap, I'm the dude followin' back
About six cars, I'm in the 'lac, and I want to (ah)

All day, all day, all night
You ask, I stay the night
With you, you say you're fire
Me too, you're burning up, I'm running

All day, all night
You feel, my heat (fire)
Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel
My heat

Hate to inconvenience you at the convenience store
But them jeans you wore, like I've never seen before
I pretend I work there while I clean the floor
Checkin' you out, like the clerk while he rings you up
Pull up behind you when you're leavin'
And you don't even know it (ayo Rick, man)

She's brushin' her hair, adjustin' her mirror
She's rappin' my shit, but she wasn't aware
I was there, or maybe she was and just didn't care
Who knows? At least that ain't up in the air

It's somethin' to see
So like a chick who thinks her coochie don't stink
If she ain't plannin' to do shit this summer's eve
Maybe she wants to keep me company
But fuck the Pepé Le Pew shit

""Ain't steppin' to you, bitch,"" I say to myself
Plus she's bumpin' my music, ain't chasin' no tail
Like a skunk in heat, I could sweat her to some degree
But fuck it, I'm the male, let her come to me
(Could you repeat that again?)
Let her come to me

Male sweater, heat, some degree, fail
Fuck it, pull up beside her
Sideswipe her, Dodge Vipe-her, with a so bright a
Ass that she wants a computer lodged in her vagina
Said my dick is an apple, she said put it inside her
I said

All day, all day, all night
You ask, I stay the night
With you, you say you're fire
Me too, you're burning up, I'm running

All day, all night
You feel, my heat (fire)
Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel
My heat

Black out, come to, hands covered in blood
Motherfuckin' gloves and a shovel stuck in the mud
I just bodied the beat, so that ho musta been dug
'Cause it just died like food coloring (duh)

So let's get turnt like a shish kabab
Twist it, ma, like an air-conditioning knob
We'd be great together, don't care if it takes forever
If I gotta wait, I guess it's better late than never

You felt my heat rubbin' off on ya
I love your personality, come on, little mama
You're hot enough to melt Rick's beat, come jump in the water
I bet you get your self-esteem from your persona

With an ass to match, girl, your body is lit
You're striking, I'm a gas, girl, you're
Just gonna have to put them other chumps on the back burner
You got buns, I got Asperger's

Just let me rest my head between that set of D's
While I shred MC's like cheddar cheese
That's just the thoroughbred in me, ain't a better breed
My dog thinks so too, look at my pedigree

Ma, the world is what I think of you
I think you're divine, so I might swing on you
I'm just kiddin', girl, I wouldn't lift a finger or two
Unless it's the middle one to finger you

All day, all day, all night
You ask, I stay the night
With you, you say you're fire
Me too, you're burning up, I'm running

Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel
My heat

On the ones and twos, to three or four in the mornin'
Rick's on the cut like Neosporin (what?)
He's mixin' it up for me and Lauren
A teddy like short for Theodore
We're outtie, five thousand
Who the fuck? It's my big dick
So everybody get ready right fucking now!"
Eminem,Offended,"You claim if you get knocked by the cops
You'll give 'em not even a statement
Walk in the arraignment
Shoot the bailiff, karate kick the plaintiff

Gotti with the stainless
I'll just call it shoddy entertainment
If y'all was in the party gettin' faded
On molly, had the audience sedated

You wouldn't catch a body if it fainted
Probably let it fall and hit the pavement
But you'd be the first lobbyin' to claim it
Bitch, stop bein' a lame

Your hobby isn't robbery and dismemberin' body limbs
Like you was Tommy Lynn Sells
And chainsawin' them in the basement
Hardly fits your job description
Ain't nobody dippin' out the back of the club
Like, ""Oh my God, he's trippin'!""
Only time you get the blade is probably with the dang lawn equipment, ain't it?
Wouldn't take a bobby pin and wave it

I need to stop bein' debated
You're still copyin', Xeroxing, I'm still copping a feel
Like Bill Cosby at will, popping a pill
Then spill Oxys in Jill's coffee
Then send her out to the hotel lobby a lil' wobbly and still groggy

This blonde fuck's reprehensible
Misconducts, never sensible
Kiss my butt, my set of principles
Is gone, but till I get the President to respond
My pen and pencil is a missile launcher
And send it to Mitch McConnell
Just as big of a bitch as Donald-shit's on, bruh

Let me sing this shit soprano
While I do it pizzicato
Ivanka, stiff arm her while I'm hittin' on Melania
And this song's for all ya

'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms
(I hope you offended)
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words
(I hope you offended)
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse
(I hope you offended)
'Cause I swear when I get up, I'm never gonna let up
Till everybody eats my turds

These drums and hard snares bring out the worst in me
Like Justin Ross Harris at a nursery
Goin' ham at candy yam on nanny cam
I'm gettin' handys with the zanny Xannys in the Caddy armrest
I'm imagining objects, so I'm batting cobwebs
From a daddy longleg

And Hamtramck, got the panoramic camera
Xanax, a banana hammock and a Santa hat
I'm smellin' like a damn mechanic
With a chick that looks like Janet Jackson with a Spanish accent
Twice your age and I'm actin' half it

Grow up? Nah, not that I know of, y'all
Basement just got a frickin' overhaul
Got a stripper pole installed
Started rollin' all through those Kolonopins like a bowlin' ball
Like an overdose on twice the ratio of Propofol
And go through no withdrawal
While I get fellatio and give a facial to
An interracial blow-up doll of Rachel Dolezal

You're so appalled (""Em...""), so's my manager
Bitch, I'm amateur, fuck a pro career
Coast is clear, but nowhere to go from here
And nobody's close, so don't compare
They ain't nowhere near, I'm way over here
My competition can't see me
'Cause I don't own a mirror

But Marshall, you are terrific, so smart and gifted
I'm so narcissistic, when I fart I sniff it
Do a fake dab to smell my armpits with it
Your anxiety's throwin' gang signs
But I made strides with these rape lines
I'm cuttin' back on women hate crimes
Like Ray Rice when he FaceTimes

Bang, bang, bang, bang time
Dang knives'll butcher them gay wives
You're gonna need sutures the same size
As the blade I push into caput'cha
When I pull 'em like

Sleigh rides
Gotta stab a bitch at least eight times to make it on Dateline
I came to stake my claim like a canine waitin' in a buffet line
So, Kellyanne Conway, I'm a really bad hombre
Come play, belly dance on me
I've been making wedding plans all day

'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms
(I hope you offended)
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words
(I hope you offended)
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse
(I hope you offended)
'Cause I swear when I get up, I'm never gonna let up
Till everybody eats my turds

Eight year old with the wordplay
Girl, take this pole like a survey
Today wasn't my birthday
But I'm caked up like a dessert tray
So we're in shape, 'cause you're in a slurrin' state
I'm a ten, you're an eight
Like what I do before, after and during rape

You wanna get into a pissin' contest and find out who's better?
And they made a fool out of what I pulled out him
R. Kelly with a full bladder
Non-high school grad, I'm not a scholar
But I'm so cold when I'm droppin' knowledge
My degrees is the same as I got in college (zero)
But nobody's hotter, you owe me my respect

I owe you nada like lodi partner that blow me
Told you I'm so dirty, homie, you can throw me in some holy water
With some floaties on and get the soap
And try to get the Pope to hold me while you hose me off
And nope, I won't be washed
You hope to God I don't explode
I gotta blow this spot up though, I got a lotta mo'
I won't put the sugar coating on it though

'Cause sometimes you can feel like your energy's expired
Rap's got you drained, dead tired, zapped
You feel like a wet pile of crap
But look, man, like the feds buggin' my phone
Uh huh, I get why you're tapped
But you gotta get your fire back
Catch fire, get upset and fire back

Is what I tell myself when times get bad
'Cause sometimes I might get sad
Well, I take the same advice I had
And tell myself like I used to tell Hailie when life's a drag
Told her to do like her dad: don't cry, get mad
'Cause little baby powders belong in diaper bags
I'm hyper, by the time you see this side of me
I'm right in your ass (sodomy)

'Fore the pen, I stood up for the kid
Who had to put up with the bullies at his school (at his school)
You ain't have to have no money
Or go shoppin' just to cop a fuckin' attitude
Now my dough's amountin' to a mountain
It's rised too high to count it
Never asked to be rich, all I did was wish
I had a dime for every time that I was doubted

But then I think about it then I'm enraged
'Cause I just figured out that if I was paid
For the time I spent to put the pen to the page
It'd be minimum wage

But it's embedded in my head
I never hunted for the bread and butter
What I wanted was to be the one that they was scared of but
I'm never gonna get the credit for the sweat and blood
I put up in the pen, and when I'm dead I wonder
Will they put me on a pedestal
Or forget I was ever this incredible
I guess I better go harder than ever
'Cause I'll never get another motherfuckin' opportunity again
To offend as many people with this I can, simply because I can

'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms
(I hope you offended)
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words
(I hope you offended)
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse
(I hope you offended)
'Cause I swear when I get up, I'm never gonna let up
Till everybody eats my turds"
Eminem,Need Me (feat. Pink),"You're drunk, the carpet is burned
I hate to find you like this
I always find you like this
I come home and clean up your mess
What would you do without that?
Why do I always come back?
Oh, what I wouldn't do for you

And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me

Some nights I want to run for the hills
It's never easy with you
I cannot reason with you
But your smile is as rare as it comes
What would I do without that?
Maybe that's why I come back
Oh, what I wouldn't do for you

And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me

Startin' to think we were made for each other
But one of us in this relationship is raisin' the other
You remind me of my mother
We drive one another crazy as each other
And we're both adults so there's no excuse
For the games that we play with each other
Where you at? At a friend's? No, you ain't, motherfucker

But I give her the benefit of the doubt
Whenever the doubt kicks in, shiver when I touch her
'Cause I love her so much, I'm a sucker
Our bottom lip can quiver when she's in trouble
She's in hot water, think I caught her cheatin' again
Give her another chance? Another one after that?
I'm swimmin' in that Egyptian river, 'cause I'm in denial
Say I don't eat shit, but I got a shit-eatin' grin when I smile
Makin' an excuse for us to act it out
She's just actin' out, with her inner child

Then I set the truth on fire
'Cause I'd rather believe a lie
Than to breathe a sigh of relieve I don't believe in
Going to bed mad, I keep on tryin'
To make a bad girl good
But haven't I stood by you in good times?
And bad? I'm startin' to feel like your goddamn dad
'Cause I literally feel like you could die of a ""should I
Leave you for good?""-so never would I
It'd be all bad, never understood why they call it goodbye
But I think I'm a pretty damn good guy
And you're a good person too
I can save you, I can make you change
But I keep puttin' my fuckin' foot in my mouth

Every time I gotta come and bail you out
When you get in trouble that you get yourself in
And I'm in trouble but I can't leave, I'll sell you out
I could never turn my fuckin' back on you, what is that?
I'm co-dependent, I'm just now noticin' it
But somehow it's like every time I'm about to go to end it

I ain't got the cojones to do it, nor the heart
Our apartment's tore apart
You're usin' my heart for a dartboard
But God must've aligned stars for us
'Cause somebody paired us up
And they say He ain't capable of makin' a mistake
But this one's perfect

'Cause I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me"
Eminem,In Your Head,"What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh

I'm packin' up my shit, as much shit in the car as I can fit
And I'm just drivin' as far as I can get
Away from these problems till all of my sorrows I forget
What's tomorrow like? 'Cause tonight I'm startin' life again

Get to the corner and stop, fuck am I goin'?
Besides psycho when I fantasize startin' my whole life over
Yeah right, oh and I might go and
Get hypnotized so I don't even recognize no one

I try to look alive because there's nothin' like holdin'
Your head up high when you're dead inside and I just hide, so in
Case you're wonderin' why my inside's showin'
'Cause I done spilled all my guts and those are mine so I'm

Pickin' 'em up and stuffin' 'em back
Fuck it, I've done enough in this rap shit
Recovery brought me nothin' but back
To where I was and perhaps
This coulda been my victory lap if I wasn't on the verge of Relapse

What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh

It seems to be the reoccurring main thing
The shit I would daydream as a kid, I was eighteen
I went from an irate teenager to still raging
Isn't it though amazing, back then I put anything

Into the rhyme, whether it was sad, mad, happy or angry
I spit it, the mainstream, I hit it
Yay me, I did it! Did what?
Hailie, baby, I didn't mean to make you eighty

Percent of what I rapped about
Maybe I shoulda did a better job at separating
Shady and entertaining from real life
But this dang thing is still the hardest thing to explain

It's the craziest shit I
Ever seen, and back then it was like I ain't even
Bothered taking into consideration
You one day being older and may hear me say things
I did it, pay me, and be, it just ain't me

Okay, so ladies and gentlemen let's strip away everything
And see the main reason that I feel like a lame piece of shit
Or should I sound cranky and bitter
Complain, beef and bicker 'bout the same things

'Cause when I look at me, I don't see what they see
I feel ashamed, greedy
And lately I've been contemplating
Escaping to get away and go wherever this road takes me
It's making me crazy what's in my

What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh"
Eminem,Castle,"I built this castle
Now we are trapped on the throne
I'm sorry we're alone
I wrote my chapter
You'll turn the page when I'm gone
I hope you'll sing along
This is your song

I just want you to know that I ain't scared
Whatever it takes to raise you, I'm prepared
To do whatever, to do whatever
December 1st, 1995, dear Hailie
This is your song

You'll be coming out of Mommy's stomach soon
I better do something quick if I'mma be able to support you
I can barely support me, but as long as you're healthy
That's all that matters for the time being
But obviously assuming you will be

Just thinking ahead, I'ma make it if it kills me
Let's see how far I can take it with this music
I'm getting sick of chasing this illusion
Sorry for sloppy writing
The pen in my hand is shaking, please excuse me

Dad's a little nervous, but at the same time excited
If I use this same energy while I'm saying rhymes and write 'em
With the same passion and the same exact enthusiasm
As I'm using in this letter, maybe they can feel me as I'm

Trying to build these castles out of sand, baby girl
For you to sit on the throne, I got plans, baby girl
Welcome to Mom and Dad's crazy world
Love, Daddy, maple-flavored kisses, buttered pancakes and syrup

I built this castle
Now we are trapped on the throne
I'm sorry we're alone
I wrote my chapter
You'll turn the page when I'm gone
I hope you'll sing along
This is your song

I just want you to know that I ain't scared
Whatever it takes to raise you, I'm prepared
To do whatever, to do whatever
December 1st, 1996, dear Hailie

You got your mama's personality, same eyes as I got
Her beautiful smile, but your ears are the same size as mine are
Sorry for that, a little minor mishap
But you'll grow into 'em, baby, I'm on the grind now

I'm doing little shows, open mics, all-nighters at studios
While I'm tryna keep the lights on
Why does it seem like I'm so close to this dream, yet so far?
I just keep steering, I'mma turn into someone

I haven't the slightest clue what I'mma do if it falls through
You took your first steps today, you'll probably walk soon
My Infinite CD flopped, too many soft tunes
They're talking bad about Dad, it's ticking me off too

Makes me feel like I don't belong or something, ooh
I think I might have just stumbled onto something new
Got a prediction for the future, I'm hoping that you
Open this envelope when you're older and it holds true

I built this castle
Now we are trapped on the throne
I'm sorry we're alone
I wrote my chapter
You'll turn the page when I'm gone
I hope you'll sing along
This is your song

I just want you to know that I ain't scared
Whatever it takes to raise you, I'm prepared
To do whatever, to do whatever
December 24th, 2007, dear Hailie

Now if you found these letters, I guess I better try to explain
A lot's happened in between them since I rised to this fame
I've said your name but always tried to hide your face
This game is crazy, I wanted to claim my love for you, but dang

I never knew it'd be like this, if I did I wouldn't have done it
You ain't asked for none of this shit, now you're being punished?!
Things that should've been private with me and your mother is public
I can't stomach, they can take this fame back, I don't want it

I'll put out this last album then I'm done with it
One-hundred percent finished
Fed up with it, I'm hanging it up, fuck it
Excuse the cursing, baby, but just know
That I'm a good person, though they portray me as cold

And if things should worsen, don't take this letter I wrote
As a goodbye note, 'cause your dad's at the end of his rope
I'm sliding down a slippery slope
Anyways sweetie, I better go
I'm getting sleepy, love, Dad... shit, I don't know"
Eminem,Arose,"If I could rewind time like a tape
Inside a boombox, one day for every pill or Percocet that I ate
Cut down on the Valium, I'da heard everything
But death is turning so definite-wait

They got me all hooked up to some machine
I love you, being, didn't want you to know I was struggling
Feels like I'm underwater submerged like a submarine
Just heard that nurse say my liver and kidneys aren't functioning

Been flirtatious with death, skirt-chasing, I guess
It's arrivederci, same nurse, just heard say they're unplugging me
And it's your birthday, Jade, I'm missing your birthday
Baby girl, I'm sorry, I fucking hate when you hurt, Hai

And sweeties, thank you for waiting to open gifts
But, girls, you can just open 'em
Dad ain't making it home for Christmas
Wish I had the strength to just blow a kiss
I go to make a fist, but I can't make one, I'm frozen stiff

I yell, but nothing comes out, I'm crying inside, I shout
My vocal cords won't permit me, I scream, but it's not aloud
You put your arm around Mama to calm her, wow
I just thought about the aisle, I'll never get to walk us down

Never see you graduate in your caps and gowns
It's 'bout to be 2008, how's this happening now?
I've got so much more to do
And, Proof, I'm truly sorry if I let you down, but this tore me in two

The thought of no more me and you
You gave me shoes, Nikes like new for me for school
Doody, I'm trying, but you, you were the glue that binded
So many things-time, I'd give anything to rewind it

I had to walk down my halls and constantly be reminded
By pictures all on my walls and I couldn't sleep at night 'cause
That image burned in my brain of you on that table
Me falling across your body, not able to stand to save you

God, why did you take him?
I'm tryna keep his legacy alive, but I'm dying, where's Nathan?
Little ladies, be brave, take care of your mother
Smile pretty for pictures, always cherish each other

I'll always love ya and I'll be in the back of your memory
And I know you'll never forget me
Just don't get sad when remembering
And, little bro, keep making me proud
You better marry that girl 'cause she's faithfully down

And when you're exchanging those sacred vows
Just know that if I could be there, I would
And should you ever see parenthood, I know you'll be good at it
Oh, almost forgot to do something, thank my father too
I actually learned a lot from you
You taught me what not to do

And, Mom, wish I'd have had the chance
To have one last heart-to-heart honest and open talk with you
Doody, I see you, I go to walk to you
And I can feel my soul leave my body and float across the room

Nurses lean over the bed, pulling tubes out
Then the sheet over my head, shut the room down
Girls, please don't get upset
I see them cheeks soaking and wet
As you squeeze hold of my neck, so forcibly, don't wanna let

Me go, pillow drenched, emotional wrecks
With every second, each closer to death
But suddenly I feel my heart begin to beat slow
Then a breath, machines go
Must've guessed the cheat codes to this shit

I'm tryna rewind time like a tape
Find an escape, make a beeline, try and awake
From this dream, I need to re-find my inner strength
To remind me, even if a steep climb I must take
To rewrite a mistake, I'm rewinding the tape

Part II: Castle Extended

(I don't want it)
I'll put out this last album, then I'm done with it
One hundred percent finished, fed up with it
I'm hanging it up, fuck it!
Excuse the cursing, baby, but just know
That I'm a good person, though they portray me as cold

And if things should worsen, but I bet you they won't
I'm pledging to throw this methadone in the toilet
Shred these old letters I wrote
All that old pathetic loathing, closing credits can roll
I'm proud to be back

I'm 'bout to, like a rematch, outdo Relapse
With Recovery, Mathers LP2
Help propel me to victory laps
Gas toward 'em and fast forward the past
Consider the last four minutes as

The song I'da sang to my daughters
If I'da made it to the hospital less than two hours later, but I fought it
And came back like a boomerang on 'em
Now a new day is dawnin'
I'm up, Tuesday, it's mornin'-now I know"
Lukas Graham,Love Someone,"There are days
I wake up and I pinch myself
You're with me, not someone else
And I am scared, yeah, I'm still scared
That it's all a dream

'Cause you still look perfect as days go by
Even the worst ones, you make me smile
I'd stop the world if it gave us time

'Cause when you love someone
You open up your heart
When you love someone
You may grow
If you love someone
And you're not afraid to lose 'em
You'll probably never love someone like I do
You'll probably never love someone like I do

When you say
You love the way I make you feel
Everything becomes so real
Don't be scared, no, don't be scared
'Cause you're all I need

And you still look perfect as days go by
Even the worst ones, you make me smile
I'd stop the world if it gave us time

'Cause when you love someone
You open up your heart
When you love someone
You may grow
If you love someone
And you're not afraid to lose 'em
You'll probably never love someone like I do
You'll probably never love someone like I do

All my life
I thought it'd be hard to find
The one 'til I found you
And I find it bittersweet
'Cause you gave me something to lose

But when you love someone
You open up your heart
When you love someone
You may grow
If you love someone
And you're not afraid to lose 'em
You'll probably never love someone like I do
You'll probably never love someone like I do
You'll probably never love someone like I do"
Passenger,Ghost Town,"Take a walk in a ghost town
The sky is black as crows
They don't make cars as they used to here

Times they change
The factories closed

Take a ride on a ghost train
Stare at the windows
See time moves fast as a hurricane
But it's so strange
It feels so slow

Well sometimes it gets so cold down here
Where I swear it burns
The wind like fire coming off of the Great Lakes
Sometimes it gets so dark in here
Hey I see it turn
The emptiness that moves within my soul
We on down in the ghost town (hey, hey, hey)

See the crash in the rust
See the ash in the dust
Feel it slipping through your hands
Falling on the shoes and the shoulders
Of the ragged man

You see the pride and the shame
Like fire and the flame
Well it burns through every mind
And drops them like drunken soldiers
On the riverbanks

Well sometimes it gets so cold down here
Yeah I swear it burns
The wind like fire coming off of the Great Lakes
Sometimes it gets so dark in here
Where I see it turn
The emptiness that moves within my soul
We on down in a ghost town

Yeah sometimes it gets so cold down here
Hey I swear it burns
The wind like fire coming off of the Great Lakes
Sometimes it gets so dark in here
Oh I see it turn
The emptiness that moves within my soul
We on down in the ghost town"
Avril Lavigne,Head Above Water,"I've gotta keep the calm before the storm
I don't want less, I don't want more
Must bar the windows and the doors
To keep me safe, to keep me warm

Yeah, my life is what I'm fighting for
Can't part the sea, can't reach the shore
And my voice becomes the driving force
I won't let this pull me overboard

God, keep my head above water
Don't let me drown, it gets harder
I'll meet you there at the altar
As I fall down to my knees
Don't let me drown, drown, drown
Don't let me, don't let me, don't let me drown

So pull me up from down below
'Cause I'm underneath the undertow
Come dry me off and hold me close
I need you now, I need you most

God, keep my head above water
Don't let me drown, it gets harder
I'll meet you there at the altar
As I fall down to my knees
Don't let me drown, drown, drown
Don't let me, don't let me, don't let me drown
Don't let me drown, drown, drown
Don't let me, don't let me, don't let me drown (keep my head above water, above water)

And I can't see in the stormy weather
I can't seem to keep it all together
And I, I can't swim the ocean like this forever
And I can't breathe

God, keep my head above water
I lose my breath at the bottom
Come rescue me, I'll be waiting
I'm too young to fall asleep

God, keep my head above water
Don't let me drown, it gets harder
I'll meet you there at the altar
As I fall down to my knees

Don't let me drown (don't let me, don't let me drown)
Don't let me drown (don't let me, don't let me drown)
Don't let me drown (don't let me, don't let me drown)
Keep my head above water, above water"
Alan Walker,Alone,"Lost in your mind
I wanna know
Am I losing my mind
Never let me go

If this night is not forever
At least we are together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone

Anywhere whenever
Apart but still together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone

Unconscious mind
I'm wide awake
Wanna feel one last time
Take my pain away

If this night is not forever
At least we are together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone

Anywhere whenever
Apart but still together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone

I'm not alone, I'm not alone
I'm not alone, I know I'm not alone
I'm not alone, I'm not alone
I'm not alone, I know I'm not alone"
Alan Walker,All Falls Down (feat. Juliander),"What's the trick? I wish I knew
I'm so done with thinking through all the things I could've been
And I know you want me, too
All it takes is that one look at you and I run right back to you
You cross that line and it's time to say F you

What's the point in saying that when you know how I'll react?
You think you can just take it back, but shit just don't work like that
You're the drug that I'm addicted to, and I want you so bad
Guess I'm stuck with you, and that's that

'Cause when it all falls down, then whatever
When it don't work out for the better
If it just ain't right, and it's time to say goodbye
When it all falls down, when it all falls down
I'll be fine
I'll be fine
You're the drug that I'm addicted to
And I want you so bad, but I'll be fine

Why we fight? I don't know
We say what hurts the most
Oh, I tried staying cold, but you take it personal
All these firing shots and making ground
It's way too hard to cope, but I still can't let you go

'Cause when it all falls down, then whatever
When it don't work out for the better
If it just ain't right, and it's time to say goodbye
When it all falls down, when it all falls down
I'll be fine
I'll be fine
You're the drug that I'm addicted to and I want you so bad
But I'll be fine

I'll be fine, fine, fine
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine
I'll be fine, fine, fine
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine
I'll be fine, fine, fine
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine
I'll be fine, fine, fine
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine

'Cause when it all falls down, then whatever (Then whatever, babe)
When it don't work out for the better (For the better)
If it just ain't right, and it's time to say goodbye
When it all falls down (When it all, when it all)
When it all falls down (When it all falls down)
I'll be fine
(Fine, fine, fine) I'll be fine (I'll be fine)
You're the drug that I'm addicted to and I want you so bad
But I'll be fine (I'll be fine), and that's that"
Alan Walker,Faded,"You were the shadow to my light
Did you feel us?
Another star
You fade away
Afraid our aim is out of sight
Wanna see us
Alight

Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Was it all in my fantasy?
Where are you now?
Were you only imaginary?

Where are you now?
Atlantis
Under the sea
Under the sea
Where are you now?
Another dream
The monster's running wild inside of me
I'm faded
I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded
I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded

These shallow waters never met what I needed
I'm letting go a deeper dive
Eternal silence of the sea. I'm breathing alive

Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Under the bright but faded lights
You've set my heart on fire
Where are you now?
Where are you now?

Where are you now?
Atlantis
Under the sea
Under the sea
Where are you now?
Another dream
The monster's running wild inside of me
I'm faded
I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded
I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded"
Alan Walker,Darkside,"We're not in love
We share no stories
Just something in your eyes

Don't be afraid
The shadows know me
Let's leave the world behind

Take me through the night
Fall into the dark side
We don't need the light
We'll live on the dark side
I see it
Let's feel it
While we're still young and fearless
Let go of the light
Fall in to the dark side
Fall in to the dark side
Give into the dark side
Let go of the light
Fall in to the dark side

Beneath the sky
As black as diamonds
We're running out of time
Don't wait for truth
To come and blind us
Let's just believe their lies

Believe it, I see it
I know that you can feel
No secrets worth keeping
So fool me like I'm dreaming

Take me through the night
Fall in to the dark side
We don't need the light
We'll live on the dark side
I see it
Let's feel it
While we're still young and fearless
Let go of the light
Fall in to the dark side
Fall in to the dark side
Give into the dark side
Let go of the light
Fall in to the dark side

Take me through the night
Fall into the dark side
We don't need the light
We'll live on the dark side
I see it
Let's feel it
While we're still young and fearless
Let go of the light
Fall in to the dark side"
Demi Lovato,Warrior,"This is a story that I have never told
I gotta get this off my chest to let it go
I need to take back the light inside you stole
You're a criminal
And you steal like you're a pro

All the pain and the truth, I wear like a battle wound
So ashamed, so confused, I was broken and bruised

And now I'm a warrior, now I've got thicker skin
I'm a warrior, I'm stronger than I've ever been
And my armor, is made of steel, you can't get in
I'm a warrior, and you can never hurt me again

Out of the ashes, I'm burning like a fire
You can save your apologies, you're nothing but a liar
I've got shame, I've got scars, that I will never show
I'm a survivor
In more ways than you know

'Cause all the pain and the truth, I wear like a battle wound
So ashamed, so confused, I'm not broken or bruised

'Cause now I'm a warrior, now I've got thicker skin
I'm a warrior, I'm stronger than I've ever been
And my armor, is made of steel, you can't get in
I'm a warrior, and you can never hurt me

There's a part of me I can't get back
A little girl grew up too fast
All it took was once, I'll never be the same
Now I'm taking back my life today
Nothing left that you can say
'Cause you are never gonna take the blame anyway

Now I'm a warrior, I got thicker skin
I'm a warrior, I'm stronger than I've ever been
And my armor, is made of steel, you can't get in
I'm a warrior, and you can never hurt me again

No, oh yeah yeah
You can never hurt me again"
Demi Lovato,Sober,"I got no excuses for all of these goodbyes
Call me when it's over 'cause I'm dying inside
Wake me when the shakes are gone
And the cold sweats disappear
Call me when it's over and myself has reappeared

I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
I do it every, every, every time
It's only when I'm lonely
Sometimes I just wanna cave and I don't wanna fight
I try and I try and I try and I try and I try
Just hold me, I'm lonely

Momma, I'm so sorry, I'm not sober anymore
And daddy, please forgive me for the drinks spilled on the floor
To the ones who never left me, we've been down this road before
I'm so sorry, I'm not sober anymore

I'm sorry to my future love for the man that left my bed
For making love the way I saved for you inside my head
And I'm sorry for the fans I lost who watched me fall again
I wanna be a role model, but I'm only human

I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
I do it every, every, every time
It's only when I'm lonely
Sometimes I just wanna cave and I don't wanna fight
I try and I try and I try and I try and I try
Just hold me, I'm lonely

Momma, I'm so sorry I'm not sober anymore
And daddy, please forgive me for the drinks spilled on the floor
To the ones who never left me, we've been down this road before
I'm so sorry, I'm not sober anymore
I'm not sober anymore

I'm sorry that I'm here again, I promise I'll get help
It wasn't my intention, I'm sorry to myself"

Anne-Marie,2002,"I will always remember
The day you kissed my lips
Light as a feather
And it went just like this
No, it's never been better
Than the summer of two thousand and two
We were only eleven
But acting like grown-ups
Like we are in the present
Drinking from plastic cups
Singing ""love is forever and ever""
Well, I guess that was true

Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
On an old Mustang, where we sang
Songs with all our childhood friends
And it went like this, say

Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
Better hit me, baby, one more time
Paint a picture for you and me
Of the days when we were young, uh
Singing at the top of both our lungs

Now we're under the covers
Fast forward to eighteen
We are more than lovers
Yeah, we are all we need
When we're holding each other
I'm taken back to two thousand and two
Yeah

Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
On an old Mustang, where we sang
Songs with all our childhood friends
And it went like this, say

Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
Better hit me, baby, one more time
Paint a picture for you and me
Of the days when we were young, uh
Singing at the top of both our lungs
On the day we fell in love
On the day we fell in love

Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
On an old Mustang, where we sang
Songs with all our childhood friends
Oh, now

Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
Better hit me, baby, one more time
Paint a picture for you and me

On the day we fell in love
On the day we fell in love
On the day we fell in love
On the day we fell in love, love, love"

Eagles,Hotel California - Remastered,"On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
""This could be heaven or this could be hell""
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (Any time of year)
You can find it here

Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends, uh
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys that she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

So I called up the Captain
""Please bring me my wine!""
He said, ""We haven't had that spirit here since 1969""
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (What a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis

Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice
And she said, ""We are all just prisoners here of our own device""
And in their masters' chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast

Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before
""Relax"", said the night man
""We are programmed to receive
You can checkout any time you like
But you can never leave"""
Maroon 5,Wait,"Dirty looks from your mother

It's September
The night came in and made her shiver
I told her she could have my jacket
Wrapped it tight around her shoulders
And I was so young
Till she kissed me
Like a whiskey
Like a whiskey

I never knew that love was blind
Till I was hers
But she was never mine
Yeah, I was reckless
But I let it burn
I let it burn, yeah
The feeling, it was bittersweet
Realizing I was in too deep
She was a lesson
I had to learn
I had to learn, yeah

I used to try to forget her
But now I smile
When I remember

Leaves are fallin'
It's September
The night came in and made her shiver
I told her she could have my jacket
Wrapped it tight around her shoulders
And I was so young
Till she kissed me
Like a whiskey
Like a whiskey

Would've left this world behind
Just to wake up by your side
Every mornin' I
Would've sold my soul
For a little more time
Would've waited a thousand nights
If she never said goodbye
I admit that I
Would've sold my soul for a little more time

I used to try to forget her
But now I smile
When I remember

Leaves are fallin'
It's September
The night came in and made her shiver
I told her she could have my jacket
Wrapped it tight around her shoulders
And I was so young
Till she kissed me
Like a whiskey
Like a whiskey

I ain't like the other Cognacs
Or type of cat that'd never call back
Or lose contact when you runnin' out of rum and you make a run
(Feelin' light and dizzy, might be tipsy)
All of that tequila's a killer, little vodka
Break her off somethin' proper
Pop a cork and play spin the bottle
(Every time you kiss me, like some whiskey)
Punch drunk love, it's a fine line
Dom Pérignon, she the fine wine
Someone call 911, I'm runnin' out of time
She done got off my heart

Leaves are fallin'
It's September (Whoa)
The night came in and made her shiver
I told her she could have my jacket
Wrapped it tight around her shoulders
And I was so young (So Young)
Till she kissed me (Yeah)
Like a whiskey (Yeah)
And I was so young (So Young)
Till she kissed me

Are we taking time or a time out?
I can't take the in-between
Asking me for space here in my house

After everything that we've been through
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you?

Distant, when we're kissing
Feel so different

Saying that you need some time to breath
Thinking that I'm sleeping on the four letter word
But the four letter word don't sleep
We goin' two separate ways
You ain't been actin' the same
You gotta go, but where your heart used to be
You gold dig every day
I switched the four door to the two door
'Cause I can't let my driver hear what you say

Are the worst of all and the blood's run stale

I want to hide the truth, I want to shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

At the curtain's call, it's the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made

Don't want to let you down but I am hellbound
Though this is all for you, don't want to hide the truth
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

They say it's what you make, I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul, I need to let you go
Your eyes, they shine so bright, I want to save that light
I can't escape this now unless you show me how

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide"
Imagine Dragons,Next To Me,"Something about the way that you walked into my living room
Casually and confident lookin' at the mess I am
But still you, still you want me
Stress lines and cigarettes, politics and deficits
Late bills and overages, screamin' and hollerin'
But still you, still you want me

Oh, I always let you down
You're shattered on the ground
But still I find you there
Next to me
And oh, stupid things I do
I'm far from good, it's true
But still I find you
Next to me

There's something about the way that you always see the pretty view
Overlook the blooded mess, always lookin' effortless
And still you, still you want me
I got no innocence, faith ain't no privilege
I am a deck of cards, vice or a game of hearts
And still you, still you want me

Oh, I always let you down
You're shattered on the ground
But still I find you there
Next to me
And oh, stupid things I do
I'm far from good, it's true
But still I find you
Next to me

So thank you for taking a chance on me
I know it isn't easy
But I hope to be worth it
So thank you for taking a chance on me
I know it isn't easy
But I hope to be worth it

Oh, I always let you down (I always let you down)
You're shattered on the ground (shattered on the ground)
But still I find you there
Next to me
And oh, stupid things I do (stupid things I do)
I'm far from good, it's true
But still I find you
Next to me (next to me)"
Imagine Dragons,Whatever It Takes,"Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling is vulturous
Negative, Nepotist

Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

Whip, whip
Run me like a race horse
Hold me like a rip cord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains

Whatever it takes
You take me to the top, I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging onto the visual
I wanna be invisible

Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough from the particle sum
I was born to run, I was born for this

Whip, whip
Run me like a race horse
Hold me like a rip cord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains

Whatever it takes
You take me to the top, I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical
Hypothetical, working onto something that I'm proud of
Out of the box an epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost

I'm an apostrophe, I'm just a symbol to reminds you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece and yet I'm half diseased
And when I am deceased

At least I go down to the grave and die happily
Leave the body of my soul to be a part of me
I do what it takes

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains

Whatever it takes
Ya take me to the top, I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes"
Imagine Dragons,Believer,"First things first
I'mma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh
The way that things have been, oh-ooh

Second thing second
Don't you tell me what you think that I can be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
The master of my sea, oh-ooh

I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Write down my poems for the few
Who looked at me took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Take up my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the

Pain
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Pain
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my god, they came from
Pain
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh
Your spirit up above, oh-ooh

I was choking in the crowd
Living my brain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke up and it rained down
It rained down, like

Pain
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain
You break me down, you built me up, believer, believer
Pain
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my god, they came from
Pain
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Last things last
By the grace of the fire and the flames
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh

But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke up and it rained down
You rained down, like

Pain
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain
You break me down, you built me up, believer, believer
Pain
I let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my god, they came from
Pain
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer"
Imagine Dragons,Walking The Wire,"Do you feel the same when I'm away from you?
Do you know the line that I'd walk for you?
We could turn around, or we could give it up
But we'll take what comes, take what comes
Oh, the storm is raging against us now
If you're afraid of falling, then don't look down
But we took the step, and we took the leap
And we'll take what comes, take what comes

Feel the wind in your hair
Feel the rush way up here

We're walking the wire, love
We're walking the wire, love
We're gonna be higher, up
We're walking the wire, wire, wire

There's nights we had to just walk away
And there's tears we'll cry, but those tears will fade
It's the price we pay when it comes to love
And we'll take what comes, take what comes

Feel the wind in your hair
Feel the rush way up here

We're walking the wire, love
We're walking the wire, love
We're gonna be higher, up
We're walking the wire, wire, wire

So look out down below
Look out down below
Look out down below
Walking the wire, wire, wire
So look out down below

Oh, I'll take your hand when thunder roars
And I'll hold you close, I'll stay the course
I promise you from up above
That we'll take what comes, take what comes, love

We're walking the wire, love
We're walking the wire, love
We're gonna be higher, up
We're walking the wire, wire, wire

So look out down below
Look out down below
Look out down below
Walking the wire, wire, wire
So look out down below"
Imagine Dragons,Rise Up,"I was hoping for an indication
I was seeking higher elevation
(Ey ey ey, ey ey ey)
I've been shaking waking in the night light
I've been breaking hiding from the spotlight
(Ey ey ey, ey ey ey)

The more I stray the less I fear
And the more I reach the more I fade away
The darkness right in front of me
Oh it's calling out and I won't walk away

I would always open up the door
Always looking up at higher floors
Want to see it all give me more (rise, rise up)
I was always up for making changes
Walking down the street meeting strangers
Flipping through my life turning pages (rise, rise up)

Like a prayer that only needs a reason
Like a hunter waiting for the season
(Ey ey ey, ey ey ey)
I was there but I was always leaving
I've been living but I was never breathing
(Ey ey ey, ey ey ey)

The more I stray the less I fear
And the more I reach the more I fade away
The darkness right in front of me
Oh it's calling out and I won't walk away

I would always open up the door
Always looking up at higher floors
Want to see it all give me more (rise, rise up)
I was always up for making changes
Walking down the street meeting strangers
Flipping through my life turning pages (rise, rise up)

I'm bursting like the fourth of July so color me and blow me away
I'm broken in the prime of my life so embrace it and leave me to stray

I would always open up the door
Always looking up at higher floors
Want to see it all give me more (rise, rise up)
I was always up for making changes
Walking down the street meeting strangers
Flipping through my life turning pages (rise, rise up)

I would always open up the door

Oh, here's to my yesterday
No tomorrow without a yesterday
Here's to my future
Goodbye to yesterday

All these years I've been searching
For who I'm supposed to be
All this time I've been wasting
'Cause I was right in front of me

By a masterful magician
But in all this trouble I've met
I haven't got one single regret, no

No tomorrow without a yesterday

'Cause I'm a hostage to my pride
By my own volition
I've been a saint, I've been the truth, I've been the lie

Oh, it's a crooked old tradition
By a masterful magician
But in all this trouble I've met
I haven't got one single regret, no

Here's to my future

A new day you can go, you can do
Anything you wanna
It's your play, swing low, go high
Anywhere you wanna
You can reach for the moon
Anywhere your dreams could take you
Go astray, fade away
Just leave it to yesterday

Here's to my future
Here's to my yesterday
Here's to change
Oh, here's to my yesterday
No tomorrow without a yesterday
Here's to my future
Goodbye to yesterday

Imagine Dragons,Thunder,"Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things and
Wanna leave my own life behind

Not a yes sir, not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder

Thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun-, thunder
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun-, thunder
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder

Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning and the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning and the thunder
Thunder, thunder

Kids were laughing in my classes
While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star

You say you're basic, you say you're easy
You're always riding in the backseat
Now I'm smiling from the stage while
You were clapping in the nose bleeds

Thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun-, thunder
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder, thunder

Imagine Dragons,Start Over,"Clenched teeth, no words
All this distance taking its toll
Speaking volumes, silence screaming over your words

I never did you right, I know that
Too many sleepless nights, I own that
I said it time and time, I know that
I want to try again

Can we start over?
Can we start over?
Can we start over?
Before it's over, over

Cold nights, cold sheets
One more lonely empty hotel room
What I'd, give to, find my way back into you

I never did you right, I know that
Too many sleepless nights, I own that
I said it time and time, I know that
I want to try again

Can we start over?
Can we start over?
Can we start over?
Before it's over, over

Can we start over?
Can we get closer?
Can we start over?
Before it's over, over

Come alive, come alive, come alive again
Come alive, come alive, come alive again
Come alive, come alive, come alive again
Come alive, come alive, come alive again
